      <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m more excited about the video series, the fact that we&#39;re inches away from the private beta launch, or that I can embed all the videos in one of Viddler&#39;s &#34;vidgets&#34;. Check them out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;object id=&#34;viddler_widget&#34; classid=&#34;clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; height=&#34;320&#34;&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;movie&#34; value=&#34;http://www.viddler.com/simple_widget/&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowScriptAccess&#34; value=&#34;always&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowFullScreen&#34; value=&#34;true&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;wmode&#34; value=&#34;transparent&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;flashvars&#34; value=&#34;widgeturl=http%3A%2F%2Fvidgets.viddler.com%2Fwidgets%2Fcallback.php%3Fwidget_type%3Dplaylist%26title%3DTrainerfly+Tutorials%26source%3Duser%26user%3DTrainerfly%26tags%3DDemo%26sort%3Duploaded-asc%26max%3D12&amp;amp;autoplay=f&#34; /&gt;&lt;embed type=&#34;application/x-shockwave-flash&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; height=&#34;320&#34; src=&#34;http://www.viddler.com/simple_widget/&#34; allowscriptaccess=&#34;always&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; name=&#34;viddler_widget&#34; wmode=&#34;transparent&#34; flashvars=&#34;widgeturl=http%3A%2F%2Fvidgets.viddler.com%2Fwidgets%2Fcallback.php%3Fwidget_type%3Dplaylist%26title%3DTrainerfly+Tutorials%26source%3Duser%26user%3DTrainerfly%26tags%3DDemo%26sort%3Duploaded-asc%26max%3D12&amp;amp;autoplay=f&#34;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Trainerfly Pre-Launch in the Works</title>
      <link>/dankleiman.github.io/2010/11/29/trainerfly-pre-launch-in-the-works/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 29 Nov 2010 14:21:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/dankleiman.github.io/2010/11/29/trainerfly-pre-launch-in-the-works/</guid>
      <description>&lt;img class=&#34;alignleft size-full wp-image-368&#34; title=&#34;Trainerfly Logo&#34; src=&#34;dankleiman.github.io/uploads/2010/11/LowerFacebook.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;280&#34; height=&#34;90&#34; /&gt;&lt;p&gt; I spent a fair amount of time today migrating, connecting, and updating. Over the last month or so, I&#39;ve been building out a wordpress front-end site for Trainerfly. My brother Sam has come through with some awesome illustration, including the logo and characters for the blog tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a funny debate about the use of flies on the site and got pretty carried away at one point. It started to look like &#34;Planet of the Flies&#34;. Too much! I&#39;m hoping now the use of flies-in-action conveys just how much Trainerfly software can act &#34;like a fly on the wall of every training session&#34; for you and your clients. &lt;img class=&#34;alignright size-medium wp-image-369&#34; title=&#34;teacher&#34; src=&#34;dankleiman.github.io/uploads/2010/11/teacher-270x300.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;270&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m using the flies in karate uniforms to signify different &#34;belt levels&#34; of site users. When trainers start out using the app, they&#39;ll be focusing on &#34;White Belt&#34; stuff like adding clients, updating program info, and sharing resources. As they get more sophisticated, &#34;Blue Belt&#34; users focus on using Trainerfly to build value for their clients, to enhance their learning experience outside of one-on-one training. Finally, I hope to have a group of &#34;Black Belt&#34; trainers eventually, who will work on building new streams of revenue with Trainerfly, that where impossible with just live training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I explain more about the belt system on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.trainerfly.com/2010/11/21/trainerfly-dojo-belt-levels/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;the Trainerfly blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll post more updates on Trainerfly development progress as I go, but if this kind of thing is of interest to you, sign up for the pre-launch email list &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.trainerfly.com/pricing/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, if you really want to help me out, become a fan of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/pages/Trainerfly/164834020218938&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Trainerfly on Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, or share this post with the FB buttons below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Trainerfly Backstory: The Moodle Project</title>
      <link>/dankleiman.github.io/2010/11/14/trainerfly-backstory-the-moodle-project/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This post is the second in a series I&#39;m doing on the backstory of how I came to develop a web-based software application called Trainerfly. You can read more about it &lt;a href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/category/trainerfly/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For about a year after I decided I need a way to manage all my clients&#39; programs, and share information with them privately, I wrestled with finding the right software. I tried private blogs, but at that time it was tons of work to partition information for each client. I tried creating a private social network for all my clients through &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ning.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Ning&lt;/a&gt;, with the idea that I would message people with their individual updates and share videos inside the network, but it never quite had the right feel. Finally, short of building something from scratch, I found Moodle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.moodle.org&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-306&#34; title=&#34;moodle-logo&#34; src=&#34;dankleiman.github.io/uploads/2010/11/moodle-logo.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;200&#34; height=&#34;46&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moodle stands for Modular Object Oriented Dynamic Learning Environment, in case you thought people just randomly came up with names for websites and programs on the internet! Basically, Moodle is an open-source online classroom software and it had everything I needed, including a huge development community, to get my clients set up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of a school structure, you have students, courses, and teachers. What I was able to do was create a unique &#34;course&#34; in which I enrolled every client as a &#34;student&#34; and I was the teacher. The nice thing about Moodle is that teachers can do lots of behind the scenes stuff, like editing courses and sharing resources that follow them around the school and most importantly for my needs, control enrollment. That was the element I was missing before. Now, every client could log in and see their program information, inside a course, but they didn&#39;t have access to anyone else&#39;s information. And, I could share the same info over and over again with different clients, with the click of the mouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-350&#34; title=&#34;student screen&#34; src=&#34;dankleiman.github.io/uploads/2010/11/student-screen2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;732&#34; height=&#34;363&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
What you&#39;re looking at above is a screen cap from a typical student program.&amp;Acirc;  After my first session with a new client, I would log in to my Moodle installation on my website and create a new client profile, a new course for them and enroll them in that course. Then, I would write up a recap of what we covered. All together it would take me five minutes to set it up and fill in the details, once the system was set up. Eventually, I was also able to share video of the exercises with them, thanks to an agreement with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.zhealth.net&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Z Health&lt;/a&gt; to test this system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After subsequent sessions, I would simply update this program section in their course with new information or new links to video, audio, or other type of files. Some trainers that I set up on this system also began to include interactive pieces, where their clients could write back to them through Moodle. Think of a regular classroom environment, with quizzes and reports and you can image the scope of things Moodle was able to do. In fact, I found it could do too much for what I needed, but more on that below...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was one other huge advantage that I want to point out of having a system like this in place. The typical trainer is juggling 20-30 clients at once throughout their training week. How do they stay organized when everyone has different goals and is working on different material? Well, for me, it became a simple matter of logging in to this system and calling up a particular client&#39;s program -- even if I hadn&#39;t seen them in 3 months, I could pick up right where we left off! Think about the confidence in me and the value they felt when they walked back into the room after a long absence and I could say, &#34;Joe, how&#39;s the right knee doing?&#34;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s part of my program dashboard where I could call up anyone&#39;s program instantly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-large wp-image-309&#34; title=&#34;program screen&#34; src=&#34;dankleiman.github.io/uploads/2010/11/program-screen-1024x640.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;600&#34; height=&#34;375&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, for about a year this was working great with my clients. As I mentioned above, I brought the concept to Z Health and they were interested in sharing this with their whole community of trainers. The next time I went out to Phoenix, I presented what I had been working on to a group of about 30 Z trainers and from there, signed up half a dozen to test the system live with their clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ll talk about the interesting things I learned from this &#34;beta test&#34; soon. Eventually, it led me to seek out someone to build brand new web app, from the ground up, based on the concept we proved in Moodle, but ultimately with a more user-friendly environment and scalable infrastructure. Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Trainerfly Backstory: The Practice Problem</title>
      <link>/dankleiman.github.io/2010/11/08/trainerfly-backstory-the-practice-problem/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Nov 2010 08:05:09 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/dankleiman.github.io/2010/11/08/trainerfly-backstory-the-practice-problem/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not alone here. Teachers in all disciples, if they need their students to practice to learn what they are teaching, will relate. I don&#39;t know if &amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;oelig;movement educators&amp;acirc;&amp;euro; have it worse because people tend to think of all movement as &amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;oelig;working out&amp;acirc;&amp;euro; -- something you go and do, not an art you have to practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, one of my favorite concepts when you are talking about getting really good at something is called &amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;oelig;deliberate practice&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;. Geoff Colvin, explains the elements of deliberate practice in &lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration: underline;&#34;&gt;Talent is Overrated&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2006/10/30/8391794/index.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Here&#39;s a summary article he wrote on CNNMoney.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to implement deliberate practice strategies has been a major shift in how I train myself and that&#39;s another story entirely. As a professional movement educator, though, I had another problem: I most of my clients for one hour a week. Maybe if I&#39;m lucky we meet in a group class setting for 3 or 4 hours a week. How can I extend a practice model to them that involves hours of practice repetition, constant feedback, goal setting, and ever-evolving mental models of the practice in such a short amount of face-to-face time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to make the deliberate practice model work, I had to decide how to spend the precious little in-person time with my clients and inspire them to cover as many of the other elements as possible outside of our one-on-one time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which would you choose? Endless repetition? Refined feedback? Goal setting? Mental models?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, it turns out to be a blend. They need to lay the foundation between sessions for refinement by getting their reps in. We can talk goal setting any time, but lots of it comes down to an emotional understanding of where they want to be that is finally sharpened face-to-face. There is an initial hump when I start to work with someone where the conceptual framework for training needs to be established, but the mental models evolve based on what they experience through practice and what other resources I can send their way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you can see where I&#39;m heading at this point. In order to make the most of one-on-one time in person, and give my clients the best possible movement education, I needed to separate out the pieces of the whole training pie that could be automated, or at least frozen in time through asynchronous communication tools (haha, fancy term for things like email and blogs!). Later, I&#39;ll explain how I began to sift through what could be leveraged and what needed to be face-to-face, but the problem started to be clearer when I realized I would have to make this distinction: &lt;em&gt;can I share this later or do I need to address it face-to-face.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
