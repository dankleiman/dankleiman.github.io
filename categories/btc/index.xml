      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m getting excited about &lt;a href=&#34;http://brooklinetaichi.org/immersion-week-2014-energy-gates-moving-qigong-exercises/&#34;&gt;Immersion Week at BTC next month&lt;/a&gt;, where we&#39;ll take another look at the Spine Stretch and the Three Swings. Another look? Like we&#39;ve done it before? Yes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is it exciting to go back to the same qigong sets over and over again?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So-called creative people understand better than most that there is nothing new under the sun. Working with boulders of granite, with empty stages, with blank paper, they are credited with making something out of nothing, but that isn&#39;t exactly what they do. All art is derived from what is in actuality a remarkably finite human experience. Whatever the medium, the creative person&#39;s task is to interpret an essentially unchanging reality, a dog-eared reality pondered by Homer and Mel Brooks and everyone in between. The artist succeeds if he or she can present something familiar from an unfamiliar angle.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash; Rheta Grimsley Johnson&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This quote comes from a book about Charles Schulz, the creator of Peanuts. &lt;a href=&#34;http://austinkleon.com/2007/10/29/the-twelve-devices-of-peanuts/&#34;&gt;In this post&lt;/a&gt;, Austin Kleon breaks down the 12 familiar devices that Schulz used over and over again to tell different stories in his comic strip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By reusing the devices, Schulz at once created context for the reader to return to and at the same time set us up to be surprised by new insights, twists, and revelations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s try to do the same thing in our qigong practice, instead of letting familiar sets become stale and dead.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/86kIjmFf9_U?rel=0&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Insight in Old Exercises&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In planning this year&#39;s event, here are the themes I hope to explore and &#34;discover.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the Spine Stretch&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How the movements reveal physical layers -- from superficial fascia to the deep muscles surrounding the spine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legwork that enhances your connection to the ground.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The difference between sinking chi and dissolving and the way this contrast will help you get more rooted (sinking) and penetrate deeper into the spine (dissolving).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finishing the spine stretch with a more integrated connection between the arms, legs, and spine and a sense of internal stillness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
See, many of these qualities can be found in a standing practice or a complex moving form of Tai Chi, but the interesting question is how we can draw them out of the procedure of the Spine Stretch. I know they&#39;re in there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the Swings&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can we release the arms throughout the swings series in a way that enhances the overall feeling of release and relaxation in the body?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How, given the degree of movement in the swings, can we tune into steady and continuous head-to-toe sinking or dissolving?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can we use the rotational motion and rhythm of the Swings to refine our feeling of the Central Channel as an axis of movement?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the end of the series, can will come to rest in a way that feels loose, alive, and settled simultaneously?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I love the challenge of extending internal awareness into an active practice like the Swings. Even as the arms are flying up above the head, you have to learn to stay grounded and connected. The rhythm and timing become an anchor for your mind in a way that&#39;s hard to get even in a slow-motion Tai Chi form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Immersion Week: April 22-25&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We&#39;ll spend 2.5 hours a day on each topic for four days, April 22-25.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be doing Swings in the morning and Spine Stretch in the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This format lets us approach all of the exercises from many different angles: direct feeling with the mind (standing qigong), partner exercises to sensitize different body parts/capacities (twisting, loosening, sinking), and mini-exercises that allow us to feel key principles/pieces of each larger exercise (arm drops and swing, kwa squats, folds, and hinges).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both events will be held at Brookline Tai Chi and there is limited space. If you plan to attend, I encourage you to sign up by April 1 to ensure a space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://brooklinetaichi.org/immersion-week-2014-energy-gates-moving-qigong-exercises/&#34;&gt;Here are the details&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you&#39;re coming in from out of town, consider extending your stay to refine your &lt;a href=&#34;http://brooklinetaichi.org/long-form-spring-series/&#34;&gt;Long Form with Craig Barnes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m very excited to share some news about two big projects with you today: Brookline Tai Chi&#39;s annual Immersion Week and the publication of the Tai Chi Way to Better Balance as a physical book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/bATZ5_2SMno?rel=0&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join me from Tuesday, April 22 - Friday, April 25 at Brookline Tai Chi in Boston for &lt;a href=&#34;http://brooklinetaichi.org/immersion-week-2014-energy-gates-moving-qigong-exercises/&#34;&gt;Energy Gates Moving Qigong Exercises&lt;/a&gt;. Times, cost, and registration details in the link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tai Chi Way to Better Balance is now available for purchase on Amazon, but you can also &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.createspace.com/4498724&#34;&gt;get your copy of the physical book directly from the publisher&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Building Better Practice Tools</title>
      <link>/dankleiman.github.io/2011/05/16/building-better-practice-tools/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 16 May 2011 09:20:57 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/dankleiman.github.io/2011/05/16/building-better-practice-tools/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m running a little experiment right now at Brookline Tai Chi to see if we can help our students develop better home practice habits. Specifically, I&#39;m experimenting with self-reporting and automated reminders to spark daily practice sessions outside of class.&lt;a id=&#34;more&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;more-1438&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, when I talk to other people in our international tai chi community, I realize what a powerful practice aid Brookline Tai Chi already is. What I mean is, the bricks-and-mortar experience of coming to the school and being around other people removes so many barriers people have to doing tai chi. It sounds too obvious to mention, but that is exactly why participating at the school is such a powerful way to build a practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this project, though, I&#39;m experimenting with email reminders and surveys to get an initial feel for what people do outside of class. I want to see if I can help them trigger more practice sessions during the week. From the initial self-reporting, it also appears that there are many daily practicers already, so I also want to see if there is a systematic way to help them shape their practice and get more out of it. Hopefully, this is the beginning of a longer conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not going to explain the experiment in detail just yet, because I want people to go through it without too much bias, but I&#39;ll share the results here once we know what we&#39;ve found. Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Brookline Tai Chi has no &#34;Former Students&#34;</title>
      <link>/dankleiman.github.io/2010/12/01/brookline-tai-chi-has-no-former-students/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2010 09:00:40 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/dankleiman.github.io/2010/12/01/brookline-tai-chi-has-no-former-students/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I keep learning and re-learning this lesson. Be very careful about calling someone, or even thinking about someone as a &#34;former student&#34;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, at BTC, we tend to think that way all the time. We work hard to keep people in classes, and when students don&#39;t come back, it&#39;s very easy to see the enrollment numbers, not the people behind them. Why don&#39;t people come back?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See? Even asking the question that way makes it seem like a &#34;yes/no&#34; distinction. Are you a student? Are you not? That&#39;s completely the wrong way to approach the issue!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as you realize that the pursuit of a movement practice is just one facet of somebody&#39;s life, and that they are possibly balancing many, many more than that, you start to understand the issue. People have lots of things going on, and just because they can&#39;t always fit classes in, doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;ve stopped practicing, or that the practice doesn&#39;t mean anything to them anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This explains why college students make horrible tai chi students. It&#39;s not them. Well, not completely....it&#39;s the systemic factors that make them such a poor fit for BTC. Two of the biggest factors: their schedules change every 4 months and they&#39;re used to getting everything for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at the other &#34;more reliable&#34; end of the spectrum. Granted, tai chi has incredible benefits for aging well, but most of our students tend to be older and therefore more settled, unencumbered with childcare for the most part, and often free to pursue their own hobbies and interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, when I think of all the &#34;former students&#34; sandwiched in between these two demographics, I&#39;m very sympathetic to the fact that things may have just gotten too busy. What&#39;s more, thinking this way motivates me to craft some kind of offering that acknowledges their busy lives, but engages the passion they still have for their practice. You&#39;ll see this kind of offering sprinkled throughout &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.brooklinetaichi.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;the BTC calendar&lt;/a&gt;, especially coming up this winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Practicing!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>YouTube AudioSwap</title>
      <link>/dankleiman.github.io/2010/11/23/youtube-audioswap/</link>

      <guid>/dankleiman.github.io/2010/11/23/youtube-audioswap/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been working on this video, documenting an instructor training we recently hosted at Brookline Tai Chi:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;object classid=&#34;clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000&#34; width=&#34;480&#34; height=&#34;385&#34; codebase=&#34;http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0&#34;&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowFullScreen&#34; value=&#34;true&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowscriptaccess&#34; value=&#34;always&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;src&#34; value=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/v/sm-DhBtxy8U?fs=1&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;rel=0&amp;amp;color1=0x006699&amp;amp;color2=0x54abd6&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowfullscreen&#34; value=&#34;true&#34; /&gt;&lt;embed type=&#34;application/x-shockwave-flash&#34; width=&#34;480&#34; height=&#34;385&#34; src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/v/sm-DhBtxy8U?fs=1&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;rel=0&amp;amp;color1=0x006699&amp;amp;color2=0x54abd6&#34; allowscriptaccess=&#34;always&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our director, Perry, selected music, but YouTube came back saying it was copyright infringement to use that track. Ok...so it gave me an alternative called AudioSwap. This is unbelievable. Basically, YouTube has a soundtrack generation engine, that you can browse by genre and artist and even filter per the length of your video. All of the tracks are fair game to use. You preview the new track and if you like it, YouTube overwrites the audio on your video with the new music. Problem solved. Indeed!&lt;/p&gt;
