      <description>Last week I had the pleasure of recording a conversation with my friend and Tai Chi colleague Dorothy Fitzer.
Drawing on her background in movement, energy arts, and psychotherapy, Dorothy has put together a very interesting group of practitioners from several different modalities to address the question of how embodiment practices can lead to nourishing, healing, and even transformative experiences.

Of course, I was thrilled to make the case that this is at the core of so much of what we do in Tai Chi.</description>

      <description>Recently, the question of &#34;should I rotate my spine in Tai Chi&#34; has come up frequently and led to a lot of confusion with some of our students.
We are told to maintain the &#34;Four Points&#34; - a sort of internal frame that runs between the shoulders and the hips, forming a box that keeps the spine from rotating or side bending while you practice Tai Chi.
Some people hear this rule and think, &#34;</description>

      <description>Checking in with one of my favorite sculptures at the Art Institute
I was thrilled to be able to share a weekend of Tai Chi in Chicago earlier this month, thanks to Energy Arts Instructor Chris Cinnamon and his students at Enso Tai Chi.
Chris just posted an incredibly detailed report summarizing the workshop here.
If you read between the lines a little bit, you can come up with some great ways to structure your own practice.</description>

      <description>Inspiration for Rooting and Lengthening in Chicago
On November 9, I&#39;ll be teaching a seminar for my friend Chris Cinnamon at Enso Tai Chi (registration details here).
This year we&#39;ll continue the &#34;Put More Chi in Your Tai Chi&#34; theme that we started last year by focusing on Tai Chi Rooting, Sinking Chi, Dissolving, and more.
The goal is to give everyone a clear sense of how nourishing it can be to find your root and feed it through solo exercises and interactive partner practice.</description>

      <title>The Problem with Learning Tai Chi from the Classics</title>
      <link>https://dankleiman.com/2013/10/09/the-problem-with-learning-tai-chi-from-the-classics/</link>

      <description>When you read the Tai Chi Classics and look at photos of the old masters, everything looks graceful, flowing, and full of life.
The problem is, your daily practice can be full of aches, pains, kinks, binds and the feeling that you&#39;re never really going to get it.
There is a lot of territory between, &#34;oh man, it hurts, I&#39;ll never get past it&#34; and &#34;be still like a mountain, flowing like a great river&#34;</description>

      <title>Tai Chi Practice Advice from Master Feng Zhiqiang</title>
      <link>https://dankleiman.com/2013/09/26/tai-chi-practice-advice-from-master-feng-zhiqiang/</link>

      <description>Feng Zhiqiang was a famous Tai Chi Master from Beijing who was a major influence on my teacher Bruce Frantzis. Master Feng did some teaching in the West as well and we are fortunate to have access to a transcript of a 2001 workshop he taught in the Bay Area (thanks to the folks at SilkReeler.com for making this transcript available and thanks to Igor for sending it my way!).</description>

      <title>Bruce Frantzis&#39; Tai Chi Mastery Program</title>

      <description>Tai Chi is becoming ever more popular in the West but the Art itself has some catching up to do. The best books on the subject are written in Chineses and the number of recognized &#34;Masters&#34; that are from the West can be literally counted on one hand. The only Grand Masters are China and it is extremely rare for a Westerner to be invited to study with them. But if the Art is to be truly understood, if Westerners are to get the most from tai chi, this cultural gap must be bridged.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Five Movement Centers</title>
      <link>https://dankleiman.com/2013/08/22/exploring-the-five-movement-centers/</link>

      <description>Allow me to share with you a Tai Chi principle so simple and clear that it is often overlooked, even by practitioners who have been doing Tai Chi for 10 years or more.
The Five Movement Centers is a template for understand HOW you move and applying it to any form you know or any repetitive movement you can perform, like going for a walk, is going to have a serious impact on how grounded, fluid, and connected you feel.</description>

      <title>Finding the Inner Form of Balance</title>

      <description>When my first Tai Chi teacher, Bruce Frantzis, came back to the US forty years ago to spread the Tai Chi he learned in China, he found out that many basic Tai Chi concepts were not being taught, either because of communications issues or lack of knowledge. Only a fraction of the vast potential of the art was being shared. Bruce set out to teach the Inner Form of Tai Chi and that&#39;s what I have studied for the last 15 years.</description>

      <description>If you listed to the recent Qigong Radio episode on Rooting, Central Equilibrium, and Balance, you probably want more insight into how to put Tai Chi balance training to work in your practice.
Now you can start Tai Chi balance training with our new eBook, &#34;An Introduction to Rooting and Stability,&#34; where you will take the Tai Chi Way to re-gaining, one of life&#39;s simplest yet most essential treasures--the gift of balance.</description>

      <title>Dragon Scans the Horizon</title>

      <description>In Tai Chi, the &#34;Dragon&#34; refers to the twisting and turning motions made with the body, usually in support of the turning of the head and neck, as when we change the direction of our gaze. Learning to turn the head correctly, supported by a rooted stance and a flexible torso, is an essential component of good balance.
The following exercise is the beginning version of Tai Chi Dragon exercises, suitable for all levels.</description>

      <title>Asymmetrical Weight Hold</title>
      <link>https://dankleiman.com/2013/08/01/asymmetrical-weight-hold/</link>

      <guid>https://dankleiman.com/2013/08/01/asymmetrical-weight-hold/</guid>
      <description>This exercise also works very rapidly to give you the sense of having a strong centerline, like a tentpole with guy-wires supporting it on either side. This is the Tai Chi quality called Zhong Ding, or Central Equilibrium.
In daily life we move, carry, hold, catch, and transfer objects of varying sizes and weights, and these pose a unique type of challenge to our equilibrium, as the body has to adapt to an additional weight outside itself.</description>
