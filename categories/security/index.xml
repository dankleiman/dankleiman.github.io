      <description>In this post, I&amp;rsquo;m going to tell you what I learned doing a series of Rails security exercises developed by Bearclaw, a Rails security consultancy.
Before I go into the exercises, though, I want to send a huge thank you to Ali Najaf, founder of Bearclaw. What I&amp;rsquo;ve learned here is due to the thoughtfulness of the exercises he&amp;rsquo;s put together and his willingness to try something new by sharing them with me.</description>
