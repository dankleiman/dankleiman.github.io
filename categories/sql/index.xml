      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are a software engineer and you have just enough SQL to write queries that count, sum, average join and maybe sub-select, then I&amp;rsquo;m writing this post for you. If, when you need more complicated analysis or computation, you pull your query results into excel or your favorite scripting language to do more processing, then I have some good news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a whole lot more you can do right in SQL and it&amp;rsquo;s not too bad to learn how to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, I&amp;rsquo;m going to cover a few concepts that have recently helped me do more computation, better analysis, and it turns out, more efficient querying&amp;hellip;and I hope they help you too.&lt;/p&gt;
