      <description>In this post, I&amp;rsquo;m going to tell you what I learned doing a series of Rails security exercises developed by Bearclaw, a Rails security consultancy.

As one of our instructors said, &amp;ldquo;Sinatra is like a stripped-down muscle car and Rails is like an RV.&amp;rdquo;
Here&amp;rsquo;s how setting up a simple &amp;ldquo;Hello, World!&amp;rdquo; app breaks down between the two.</description>
