      <description>I just started working with Bruce&#39;s new meditation program. I&#39;m very excited to hear him framing this home-study series in terms of rhythms, pacing, and long term development. Every couple of weeks he&#39;s putting out new guided practice recordings, which I think will be easy to follow-through on and fresh enough to keep people tuned into their practice. I&#39;ll let you know how it goes!

      <description>This one is for the Energy Arts Certified Instructors. The new EA website allows you to change the details of your instructor profile when you have a registered account. I think having accurate and updated information is helpful, especially if you decide to become an active contributor on the forum.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been working with the team at Energy Arts on various projects, but mainly in the capacity as a community coordinator. Currently, my focus is on helping them get a new community discussion forum off the ground, but I also had the chance to participate in the launch of their new Ba Gua Mastery Program.
The Ba Gua Mastery Program is a home-study program with information on circle-walking for meditation and martial arts.</description>
