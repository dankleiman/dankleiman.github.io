      <title>Breathing Techniques: Am I Doing it Right?</title>

      <description>I recently received this breathing question and I thought it was worth sharing with everyone here as a post. (Don&#39;t forget, you can send me your practice questions!)
I&#39;m really confused! I took a Yang Style Tai Chi course and at the end of the class we would do Qigong. He said &#34;We will do diaphragmatic breathing. As you breath in draw the navel into the spine, as you exhale release and let the belly relax but don&#39;t collapse.</description>

      <title>Immersion Week 2014 Update</title>

      <description>Here&#39;s a quick update on what we&#39;ve been working on during Immersion Week 2014.

I&#39;m very impressed (and I say so in the video about 15 times!) with the way this group has patiently explored many different facets of the Swings and Spine Stretch without rushing ahead to try to fit seemingly contradictory pieces together conceptually.
Instead, they&#39;re doing a great job experiencing/exploring each different component on its own.</description>

      <description>When you settle into your practice each day, you should always give yourself a couple of minutes to just feel and see where your body, your energy, and your awareness are.
In one sense, each practice session is about bringing the rhythms of each of those into harmony.
That&#39;s why Tai Chi and qigong can be so powerfully restorative.
So, if you take a couple of minutes to just &#34;settle in,&#34;</description>

      <title>Energy Gates Moving Exercises: Immersion Week 2014</title>

      <description>I&#39;m getting excited about Immersion Week at BTC next month, where we&#39;ll take another look at the Spine Stretch and the Three Swings. Another look? Like we&#39;ve done it before? Yes!
Why is it exciting to go back to the same qigong sets over and over again?
So-called creative people understand better than most that there is nothing new under the sun. Working with boulders of granite, with empty stages, with blank paper, they are credited with making something out of nothing, but that isn&#39;t exactly what they do.</description>

      <title>Don&#39;t Dissolve Your Blockages</title>
      <link>https://dankleiman.com/2014/03/13/dont-dissolve-your-blockages/</link>

      <description>That&#39;s right, don&#39;t dissolve blocked energy, tension, or contraction in your body....let it dissolve.
Now, that might seem like a fine semantic distinction, but it captures an attitude towards practice that is essential for energetic resolution and finding deeper layers of the mind.
Let your body relax.
Let your chi sink through the structure of your joints and bones.
Let your mind land on the body.
Let the blockages dissolve.</description>

      <title>Embrace the Cold to Feel Your Chi</title>

      <description>It&#39;s been such a cold winter in the Northeastern US this year, that even Niagara Falls has frozen over. Every night, students come in to class shivering, that is, once they&#39;ve resolved to venture out in the cold and the dark. And many haven&#39;t even been up for that.
Today I want to tell you about an important practice lesson you can learn from all this cold. You will develop a better feel for the chi of your etheric body and stay warmer in the process.</description>

      <title>When to Follow a Practice Recipe and When to Reflect on Your Practice</title>

      <description>In this video, we&#39;re talking about building up the skill of Outer Dissolving in your standing qigong practice.
When you start out, it pays to follow a recipe - a set of instructions that lead through a certain procedure physically, energetically, and with your mind. However, there are times you want to break away from the recipe and times you&#39;ll want to reflect on your experience verbally -- but there are good and bad ways to do both.</description>

      <title>The Recipe for Rewarding Practice</title>

      <guid>https://dankleiman.com/2014/01/30/the-recipe-for-rewarding-practice/</guid>
      <description>&#34;Is it better to structure your practice to stay with one energy gate, such as the crown, until you feel some dissolving happening there, or should you just keep moving through the gates week by week moving onto another gate?&#34;
Excellent questions like this one keep pouring in. Thank you for sharing your practice experiences with me. I know other folks who read the blog really appreciate it too.
I love hearing from you guys, especially when your questions are grounded in exploration, practice and thoughtful reflection.</description>

      <title>Dissolving, Breathing, Structure, and Stillness: Follow-Up Q&amp;A</title>

      <description>Thanks to everyone who reached out with questions about the first standing audio practice in the Energy Gates Dissolving series.
I want to share some of the questions with you here. Please let me know if you have any follow-up questions or comments or think there is anything the needs clarification. Hopefully we can approach this series together as an ongoing learning process!
What&#39;s the Difference between Outer Dissolving, Downward Dissolving, and Sinking?</description>

      <description>If you read last week&#39;s post on standing qigong and the Energy Gates book, or better yet, you can stand comfortably &#34;just feeling&#34; for 15-20 minutes, you&#39;re probably ready to embark on the downward dissolving process.
This week, I want to help you get started.
I recorded a guided practice mp3 to get you through the first workout in the Energy Gates series: Feeling the Gate at the Crown of the Head.</description>

      <title>Form Versus Feel in Standing Qigong</title>
      <link>https://dankleiman.com/2014/01/09/form-versus-feel-in-standing-qigong/</link>

      <description>When you set out to develop your internal energy using standing postures, there are two main ways you can go about it: by feel or by form.
Now, there will be a lot of overlap in these two broad approaches, like aligning your body with gravity without collapsing internally and progressively releasing and relaxing as you stand, but when it comes to the role of the mind, form and feel can be very different.</description>

      <title>Outer Dissolving and The Role of the Mind in Standing Qigong</title>

      <description>Next month, we&#39;ll be starting a new Energy Gates course at Brookline Tai Chi, focused on Outer Dissolving and working through the Gates of the body.
When you work on dissolving the gates, you will inevitably be fighting the urge to:
 visualize instead of feel &#34;chase&#34; energetic releases, untethered from the physical body wonder if you are really feeling anything at all

In this episode of Qigong Radio, I&#39;ll give my recommendations for avoiding these pitfalls and for setting up the conditions for actual energetic resolution.</description>

      <title>The Itch to Move Your Chi</title>

      <description>We tend to think about our energy level like the money we have in the bank. You wake up in the morning, look in your energetic wallet and say, &#34;I&#39;ve got a lot of energy today&#34; or &#34;Man, I need 7 cups of coffee.&#34;
Or, to put it another way, thanks to this New Yorker cartoon:

In qigong, we think about &#34;having energy&#34; a little bit differently. Often, it&#39;s not just how much or how little, but how well is your energy circulating?</description>

      <title>Chasing Secrets and Shortcuts in Taoist Energy Arts</title>

      <description>When you set out to learn Taoist Energy Arts like Tai Chi, qigong, or meditation, you come across the lore of masters with supernatural abilities or techniques too deadly to teach openly.
Or more insidious, we grasp after images of unattainable perfection, always slightly beyond reach, unless we just find the right technique or are initiated into a secret practice.
And even if we&#39;ve given up silly kung fu fantasies of flying through the bamboo reeds, on a subtle level we still chase ideas and dreams that only live in the mental realm.</description>

      <description>One of the most satisfying things about running this site is when you guys reach out and ask questions about Qigong and Tai Chi.
Today, I wanted to share with you 3 of the most common ones I get about starting up a qigong practice (and if you have a different one, something I&#39;ve missed, let me hear about it!). Hopefully, these questions will line up with something you&#39;ve been thinking about in your practice too (again, let me know in the comments!</description>
