      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last weekend, I had the chance to volunteer at a GoBridge event taught by Bill Kennedy of Ardan Labs. I&amp;rsquo;m trying to make &lt;a href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/blog/2016/12/29/my-5-strategies-for-learning-go-in-2017/&#34;&gt;2017 my year of learning Go&lt;/a&gt;, so helping out at the event felt like a natural extension and a great way to connect with more people in the Go community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going in with Ruby as my first language, I braced myself for static typing and wanted concurrent programming to bend my brain, but that&amp;rsquo;s not really what happened at all.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past couple of years, one thing I&amp;rsquo;ve become more and more aware of is the unease and uncertainty of diving into a new project. Not matter what the new X is, I find I always go through the same set of uncomfortable feelings on my initial approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, though, I&amp;rsquo;m starting to become familiar enough with this process that &amp;ndash; even though the discomfort doesn&amp;rsquo;t go away in the initial learning stages &amp;ndash; I can embrace it, coexist with it, and forge ahead in learning, because of the strategies I&amp;rsquo;m going to lay out here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
