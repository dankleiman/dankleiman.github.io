      <description>&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/5c/Calder_Flamingo.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;253&#34; /&gt;&lt;p&gt; Inspiration for Rooting and Lengthening in Chicago&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On November 9, I&#39;ll be teaching a seminar for my friend Chris Cinnamon at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.chicagotaichi.org/&#34;&gt;Enso Tai Chi&lt;/a&gt; (registration details &lt;a title=&#34;Seminars&#34; href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/seminars/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year we&#39;ll continue the &#34;Put More Chi in Your Tai Chi&#34; theme that we started last year by focusing on Tai Chi Rooting, Sinking Chi, Dissolving, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is to give everyone a clear sense of how nourishing it can be to find your root and feed it through solo exercises and interactive partner practice. Basically, you learn to continuously release and dissolve tension, stress, and pain, but more than just shedding uncomfortable feelings, you actually tap into a restorative wellspring of energy that keeps bubbling up the more you go down into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re in the area, come join us for a great day of training!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For background on the seminar, it helps to understand the different facets of Tai Chi Rooting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Two Kinds of Tai Chi Rooting&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
My Push Hands teacher &lt;a title=&#34;The Essential Elements of Tai Chi Balance Training&#34; href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/2013/07/18/the-essential-elements-of-tai-chi-balance-training/&#34;&gt;Don Miller&lt;/a&gt; explains that there are two kind of &#34;root&#34; in Tai Chi: &lt;strong&gt;intrinsic root&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;situational root&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intrinsic root is the degree of root you are either born with, or have developed through practice over time, that spills into everything you do. Think of the most grounded person you know. They exude a high degree of intrinsic root, either physically or emotionally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the fruits of Tai Chi practice have to do with increasing your intrinsic root and this is often why we see people mellow or soften as their practice matures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cultivating Intrinsic Root&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The most common way to build intrinsic root in Tai Chi is through standing practices, either holding qigong postures or postures drawn directly from the Tai Chi form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, you&#39;re not just &#34;standing around.&#34; You have to go through &lt;a title=&#34;Guide to Standing Qigong&#34; href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/exercises/guide-to-standing-qigong/&#34;&gt;several stages&lt;/a&gt; to get to rooting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, you have to land the mind inside the body, or at least on, and begin to become present to sensations other than pain and discomfort.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then, you have to let the mind soak deeper and deeper into the body, transforming the tissues, making them wetter, heavier, and denser. This will happen naturally, like water soaking into a sponge, as circulation of fluids and chi increases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, as you refine your posture and alignments, the heavy feeling will move &lt;em&gt;through you&lt;/em&gt;, instead of just weighing you down (which is a sign of internal collapse). You start to feel lighter and more open, but someone lifting up your arms or legs would still perceive the heaviness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In some standing qigong methods, like &lt;a title=&#34;Opening the Energy Gates by Bruce Frantzis is The Most Important Qigong Book To Have in Your Library&#34; href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/2011/10/31/opening-the-energy-gates-by-bruce-frantzis-is-the-most-important-qigong-book-to-have-in-your-library/&#34;&gt;Opening the Energy Gates&lt;/a&gt;, there is also a method for refining your sense of blocked internal energy, so that you begin to &#34;dissolve&#34; blocked chi. While dissolving is a healthy practice to undertake for its own sake, in this context, &lt;strong&gt;it gives you an extra advantage: as you become more aware of your internal energy, you start to feel the &#34;chi of ____.&#34; &lt;/strong&gt;In other words, you feel the chi of your leg or your kidneys or your feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of rooting, you begin to notice that your mind, and therefore your chi, has jumped up into your head, and is no longer feeding your root through your legs....and you notice this right before you go flying away!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rooting as a Response&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In the following video, I show how situational root, or rooting as a response to another person, has to do with finding just the right amount of sinking and grounding, not fighting or running away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/embed/dbt1nC9jypI&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; width=&#34;560&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here again, Lee I-Yu&#39;s advice from &lt;a href=&#34;http://scheele.org/lee/classics.html#Essentials&#34;&gt;The Essentials of the Practice of the Form and Push Hands&lt;/a&gt; is very helpful:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Desiring to attract to emptiness and deflect a thousand pounds, first you must know yourself and others. If you want to know yourself and others, you must give up yourself and follow others. If you give up yourself and follow others, first you must have the correct timing and position. To obtain the correct timing and position, you must first make your body one unit. Desiring to make the body one unit, you must first eliminate hollows and protuberances. To make the whole body without breaks or holes, you must first have the &lt;i&gt;shen&lt;/i&gt; [spirit of vitality] and &lt;i&gt;ch&#39;i&lt;/i&gt; [vital life energy] excited and expanded. If you want the &lt;i&gt;shen&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ch&#39;i&lt;/i&gt; activated and expanded, you must first raise the spirit (pay attention) and the &lt;i&gt;shen&lt;/i&gt; should not be unfocussed. To have your &lt;i&gt;shen&lt;/i&gt; not unfocussed, you must first have the &lt;i&gt;shen&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ch&#39;i &lt;/i&gt;gather and penetrate the bones. Desiring the &lt;i&gt;shen&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ch&#39;i&lt;/i&gt; to penetrate the bones, first you must strengthen the two thighs and loosen the two shoulders and let the &lt;i&gt;ch&#39;i&lt;/i&gt; sink down.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In other words, what makes situational root work is listening to the other person and responding to them at the right time, with the right sensitivity, with unified energy and an open body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What that will look like in your practice, over time, is something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn to feel your body&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sink your chi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open your energy field and correct alignments so that the physical body helps the energy become as full as possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add more complex movements that challenge your ability to stay present to your own internal state&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn interactive practices that teach you to tune into someone else&#39;s movement and energy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and finally, practice being grounded in the face of challenging interactions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Of course, like all Taoist learning processes, this one is circular. So while there are stages of skills to master here, you will also find that every time you go back to something earlier on the list, you will get more and more depth and richness out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the November 9 workshop, we will try to touch on as much of this as possible, including techniques for unifying the body and energy, sinking and dissolving chi, feeding the root through interactive practices, and also exploring how to use the solo Tai Chi form as a vessel for integrating as much of this as possible. &lt;a title=&#34;Seminars&#34; href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/seminars/&#34;&gt;Learn more here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Finding the Inner Form of Balance</title>
      <link>/dankleiman.github.io/2013/08/16/finding-the-inner-form-of-balance/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 16 Aug 2013 09:15:28 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/dankleiman.github.io/2013/08/16/finding-the-inner-form-of-balance/</guid>
      <description>&lt;img class=&#34;alignleft size-medium wp-image-4807&#34; alt=&#34;Ocean Balance Rocks&#34; src=&#34;dankleiman.github.io/uploads/2013/08/iStock_000020131551XSmall-300x198.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;198&#34; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;When my first Tai Chi teacher, &lt;a title=&#34;Bruce Frantzis Tai Chi Resources&#34; href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/bruce-frantzis-tai-chi-resources/&#34;&gt;Bruce Frantzis&lt;/a&gt;, came back to the US forty years ago to spread the Tai Chi he learned in China, he found out that many basic Tai Chi concepts were not being taught, either because of communications issues or lack of knowledge. Only a fraction of the vast potential of the art was being shared. Bruce set out to teach &lt;em&gt;the Inner Form of Tai Chi&lt;/em&gt; and that&#39;s what I have studied for the last 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of endless forms and choreography, we dove into the inner workings &lt;a title=&#34;Tai Chi&#39;s Most Powerful Technique&#34; href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/2012/11/06/tai-chi-most-powerful-technique/&#34;&gt;that make Tai Chi so powerful for restoring health &lt;/a&gt;and unlocking hidden internal energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Tai Chi is moving into a new phase of popular understanding in the West.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Brookline Tai Chi, we are being approached more and more often by insurance companies, federal and state government agencies, and research universities to weigh in on what makes an effective Tai Chi balance training program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tai Chi is being brought into a medical context, but I worry that we will just repeat Tai Chi&#39;s last emergence onto the Western scene: as a watered-down shell of what it could be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For that reason, I have sought out another champion of the Inner Form approach to Tai Chi to help me share with you the real Tai Chi Way to Better Balance. Don Ethan Miller has practiced and taught Tai Chi for more than 40 years, won national titles in Tai Chi Push Hands and has, in my opinion, a unique, direct, and profound approach to Tai Chi education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re working together on the &lt;a title=&#34;The Tai Chi Way to Better Balance&#34; href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/better-balance/&#34;&gt;Tai Chi Way to Better Balance&lt;/a&gt; and I wanted to share with you why I think Don&#39;s approach to teaching Tai Chi is going to be so useful for your own practice and for when you want to share Tai Chi with the people around you whose balance is failing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Simple, Yet Profound&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The exercises in the program may seem simple at first. They are accessible to almost any level of physical fitness and balance. In fact, the exercises are precisely layered (more on that below) to allow almost anyone to regain their balance safely and gradually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here&#39;s the thing. I have seen firsthand, watching Don teach these exercises to people who have done Tai Chi for 5, 10 or even 20 years, that if you, the experienced Tai Chi practitioner, approach the program with an open mind, you will reignite your stale or faltering Tai Chi practice. Seasoned practitioners will find depth in the simplest instructions here and marvel at the layers of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re anything like me, you&#39;ll be jealous of the beginners who take on this program, because they&#39;re getting the depth you had to search for years to find, going from teacher to teacher for bits and pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Feel, Then Do&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For those of you who are new to Tai Chi, chances are, if you wander into your local YMCA or church Tai Chi class, you&#39;ll be thrown into &#34;The Form.&#34; With a great teacher, the form will be presented alongside the principles (Inner Form!) that make the movements work. Too often, though, the principles are absent and you&#39;re just asked to follow along until you get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To us, especially if you have the urgent need to improve your balance, this is the long way around&amp;hellip;in the best-case scenario. At worst, you fumble around, get frustrated and quit. No benefit there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You won&#39;t find a forms-based approach here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, follow this simple rule as you work through the exercises in the program: &lt;strong&gt;feel, then do&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a practically limitless space to feel into when you open up your inner world with Tai Chi. From &lt;a title=&#34;Wu Chi&#34; href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/wu-chi/&#34;&gt;the very first exercise&lt;/a&gt;, you&#39;ll be asked to explore by feel. This is Tai Chi from the inside out. It&#39;s all about what you learn to feel. And feeling leads to moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After each exercise, you will also feel and reflect on what you&#39;ve just done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, Don is like a master chef. He&#39;s crafted a book of recipes for you here. All the ingredients are laid out. The directions are clear. You just need to put them together and then, enjoy the dish. Taste it. Savor it. And be satiated with the wonderful, nurturing meals you are cooking for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Layers of Progress&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As you work through the levels in the program, you&#39;ll notice that the skills you build are layered one on top of the next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First you get comfortable on two legs, with no distractions. But what happens when you only have one leg to stand on? &lt;a title=&#34;Dragon Scans the Horizon&#34; href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/dragon-scans-the-horizon/&#34;&gt;Or you add an arm motion and a head turn?&lt;/a&gt; Slowly, you will add layers, and each time, you will understand how the new layer makes you stronger, more stable, and more internally connected in accordance with key Tai Chi principles like Rooting and Central Equilibrium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the complexity of the exercises increase, so will your rate of discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see people burst out of classes all the time. They can&#39;t wait to bounce down the street or frolic in the park. It&#39;s kind of goofy when you their eyes light up like little kids again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&#39;s what I wish for you and hope we can share with the world about the Tai Chi Way to Better Balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later this month, we will be releasing the first DVD and eBook in this program, but you can start working on Tai Chi balance training right now. &lt;a title=&#34;The Tai Chi Way to Better Balance&#34; href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/better-balance/&#34;&gt;Click here to learn more.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Connection Between Rooting and Strength in Tai Chi</title>
      <link>/dankleiman.github.io/2013/07/26/the-connection-between-rooting-and-strength-in-tai-chi/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 26 Jul 2013 08:42:23 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/dankleiman.github.io/2013/07/26/the-connection-between-rooting-and-strength-in-tai-chi/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a recent post, we looked at &lt;a title=&#34;5 Ways to Build Stronger Legs Using Tai Chi Exercises&#34; href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/2013/07/02/5-ways-to-build-stronger-legs-using-tai-chi-exercises/&#34;&gt;5 Ways to Build Strong Legs&lt;/a&gt;. When I posted &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j34DhSHvaxo&amp;amp;feature=share&amp;amp;list=UU4DJ7xUL-TWEBOgDp_ekI5Q&#34;&gt;the video to Youtube&lt;/a&gt;, someone replied:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think nowadays there is a great misunderstanding of internal martial arts goals and methodology. The great issue is not to become strong but to become very weak!&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Now, I think the commenter is &lt;em&gt;kind of&lt;/em&gt; right, but misses a critical point, by simply reducing Tai Chi to the art of getting weaker and weaker. Just look at these Tai Chi Masters, &lt;strong&gt;specifically in the legs&lt;/strong&gt;, and tell me if they seem weak:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;http://taiji.scotthuette.net/files/2012/02/tai-chi-master-liu-hung-chieh.png&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;409&#34; /&gt;&lt;p&gt; Master Liu Hung Chieh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;http://www.sunion.warwick.ac.uk/socs/su173/Wu%20Jienquan.PNG&#34; width=&#34;310&#34; height=&#34;465&#34; /&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wu Style Tai Chi Founder Wu Jian Quan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;http://taijionmaui.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/hu-ling.jpg&#34; width=&#34;550&#34; height=&#34;586&#34; /&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yang Style Master Tung Hu Ling&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no weakness in these Masters. You can see softness, an immense amount of relaxation, and they almost glow with internal calm. But weakness? Not here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is the connection between the strength and the stillness they display? If you listed to last week&#39;s &lt;a title=&#34;The Essential Elements of Tai Chi Balance Training&#34; href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/2013/07/18/the-essential-elements-of-tai-chi-balance-training/&#34;&gt;Qigong Radio episode on Tai Chi for Better Balance&lt;/a&gt;, you heard me discuss &#34;Rooting&#34; with Don Miller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a 4-minute clip from the episode, where Don specifically draws the connection between strength, stability, balance, and relaxation. When you have Tai Chi Root, you can have them all.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Becoming a Giant Rooted Spring in Tai Chi</title>
      <link>/dankleiman.github.io/2012/05/14/becoming-a-giant-rooted-spring-in-tai-chi/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 14 May 2012 09:22:51 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/dankleiman.github.io/2012/05/14/becoming-a-giant-rooted-spring-in-tai-chi/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When you relax into the turning of the waist and feel how it connects to the legs, you begin a process of rooting while moving that creates a dynamic and springy stability. Kind of a paradox, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You feel like a giant spring, anchored to the floor even though you&#39;re moving around, that is constantly being wound up and then released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to cultivating this connection is how you relax through your turning, so let&#39;s start off by getting clear on what we mean when we say relaxation. &lt;a id=&#34;more&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;more-3897&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too often, people conflate relaxation with just slumping on the couch. In Tai Chi, we actually mean, &#34;moving in a way that doesn&#39;t constrict your nervous system and even more, having a sense of continuously releasing the nerves as you practice.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/2012/03/29/qigong-radio-episode-2-developing-your-soft-tissue-with-paul-cavel/&#34;&gt;Paul Cavel gave some great advice on the progression from turning to twisting to spiraling for Qigong Radio.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are relaxing into more and more leg and waist turning, your goal is to get connected all the way to the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s an example:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/embed/HolPGfI3KVc?rel=0&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the &lt;a href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/tag/tai-chi-mastery-program/&#34;&gt;Tai Chi Mastery program&lt;/a&gt;, Bruce explains how letting this turning penetrate the legs actually protects the joints of the legs and lower spine.&lt;/strong&gt; You must simultaneously relax the nerves and the tissue to allow for turning, but also keep space in all the joints, &lt;em&gt;so the turning movements pass through the joints.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the key points to develop this quality in your practice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turning from the waist should eventually feel like it directly screws the foot into the floor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turning must go through both legs in all stances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look for sections of the leg that stop turning because these freeze points will put pressure on the joints in that area (thigh or lower leg on the knee, for example, or hips/glutes on the lower spine).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You can practice this continuously in the Tai Chi form or &lt;a href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/2012/02/20/turn-the-legs-to-turn-the-body/&#34;&gt;in a variety of other movement patterns&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
