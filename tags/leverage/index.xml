      <description>Pro: My Car Broke Down and I Was Actually Happy about It
I guess I need to explain that a little more. I wasn&#39;t really happy that it broke down. I was on the way to Maine to teach the tai chi group in Farmington, so that sucked. And it was the clutch the completely died, so I knew it was going to be a few dollars to repair. But that was actually part of the silver lining.</description>

      <description>Over the last month or so, I&#39;ve gotten Trainerfly out into people&#39;s hands and I&#39;ve been learning some really interesting lessons. I think it was easy for me to get wrapped up in how I&#39;ve evolved it as a tool in my business over the last two years and lose perspective on how other people might be trying to add it into their business from scratch, with none of that prior history.</description>

      <description>It&#39;s the end of the year and it&#39;s time to get out of old habits and mindsets.
So, here&#39;s my prediction for the best business model for independent fitness and wellness pros, for the next DECADE. Yeah, I think it&#39;s going to take a few years to unfold, but the groundwork has been laid:
 No more brick-and-mortar businesses. Trust me, I know what it&#39;s like to cut a $10,000 rent check each month.</description>

      <description>Over at TechCrunch, Stephen Martin lays out his thesis about an interesting turning point for entrepreneurs in this economic climate. I could quote the piece at length, but I think this part is especially important:
These business mavericks live by a new dynamic of success &amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&#34; unique individual strengths, expertise and credibility &amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&#34; fueled by today&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;s cultural and technological changes. In this new dimension of business lies the secret to success in our transformed world of commerce.</description>

      <description>You probably don&#39;t realize it, but there is a good chance you are letting a lot of extra money in your business slip right out of your hands. In fact, if you don&#39;t have good systems in place, I can almost guarantee it. In this post I&#39;ll pull back the curtain and show you some of the systems I use to keep things running tighter. Specifically, I&#39;m going to tell you about an end of year/new year&#39;s marketing campaign, targeting my private clients from 2010.</description>
