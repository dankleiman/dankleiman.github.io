      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;Chess at Starbucks by radioflyer007, on Flickr&#34; href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/radioflyer007/4677003347/&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignleft&#34; src=&#34;http://farm2.staticflickr.com/1304/4677003347_3bcb440632.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Chess at Starbucks&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;205&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;At this time of year, you hear a lot about New Year&#39;s resolutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, I was happy to see a lot of people saying &#34;New Year&#39;s resolutions don&#39;t work.&#34; We all know that&#39;s true from personal experience, but these folks were referencing a growing understanding about how learning and skill-building take place. Most of what we now know about how the nervous system works flies in the face of changing through the strength of your willpower alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I urge you to leave that mindset behind in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, you should think about any changes, anything you want to learn, as slowing building a skill, with small steps you can practice, building like a snowball, until you&#39;re doing great new things without trying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s how that works.&lt;a id=&#34;more&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;more-3160&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deliberate Practice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You often hear people say, &#34;practice makes perfect&#34;, but the reality is a little more complicated. One retort is &#34;practice makes permanent&#34;, which speaks to the way that your nervous system ingrains what you do over and over so that it becomes close to automatic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you actually want to learn something new this year, you need get smart about how you build your new skills. The model that captures this the clearest is the deliberate practice model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deliberate practice has four components:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need a framework for understanding what to practice -- this is where seeking out guidance from someone who has mastered that skill or taught others to do so is critical.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have to practice a very specific skill because you need a high degree of focus -- trying to juggle two or three new things at a time won&#39;t work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need immediate feedback on your practice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need to practice over and over and over again, a lot.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The irony for most of us is that we want to get better at something, so we just go out and do it. It&#39;s like trying to drive somewhere new without a map. You&#39;ll base your decisions, turn-by-turn, on old information about places you&#39;ve been before, which may work pretty well, but clearly won&#39;t get you there with the same directness as having a roadmap to guide you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, step one of any new deliberate practice endeavor that you seek out is to find the right map. Get good guidance, regular feedback, and keep practicing, biting off a little at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only other thing you need to worry about, once you have the deliberate practice cycle down, is staying in a healthy &#34;learning zone&#34; as you take on new skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Recognizing Fight-or-Flight&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A natural part of trying to master any new skill is working beyond your current capacity. The problem is that pushing yourself too far into new territory will be counter-productive. When you exceed your limites, your body initiates the fight-or-flight response and you will no longer engage in productive learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the core Z Health training principles is learning to identify the onset of the stress response in any activity. When you recognize the signs of fight-or-flight, you learn to dial back your training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, you may find:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your heart rate speeds up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your breathing gets heavy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your face becomes flushed or pale or alternates between them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your mouth dries up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You move toward the fetal position in subtle ways -- your shoulders hike up, your facial muscles contract, you draw your arms in to protect your body.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You stop hearing what&#39;s going on around you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You get &#34;tunnel vision&#34; and lose your peripheral field.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When you experience these things, or more likely, when someone points out to you that they are happening or you realize it in hindsight, you know you&#39;ve exceeded your capacity to integrate new information in that moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see the poise and relaxation that comes through smart, modulated training in this boxing clip. Obviously, boxing can be a brutal sport, but watch the way that this training is structured, to stretch him in different ways, testing his visual skills, playing with his threat level and capacity to integrated movement information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know that the training is done correctly because of how graceful and relaxed he is able to be under this kind of pressure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;object width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; classid=&#34;clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000&#34; codebase=&#34;http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0&#34;&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowFullScreen&#34; value=&#34;true&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowscriptaccess&#34; value=&#34;always&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;src&#34; value=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/v/2y5jB0uZOrM?version=3&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;rel=0&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowfullscreen&#34; value=&#34;true&#34; /&gt;&lt;embed width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; type=&#34;application/x-shockwave-flash&#34; src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/v/2y5jB0uZOrM?version=3&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;rel=0&#34; allowFullScreen=&#34;true&#34; allowscriptaccess=&#34;always&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; /&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you work through this process, probably without an army of coaches, camera crews, and fans, you&#39;ll have to look back on the experience and break down how things came together and what you could do to decrease the threat level next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another one of my favorite examples of this is a college football coach who plays crowd noise over the loudspeaker during practice sessions. He wants his players to simulate game conditions as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine the gradual increase in game-like threat levels as they learn new skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe the coach introduces a new play in the locker room. He maps it out for the players and they get the idea. Next, they head to the field without pads on and with no defense trying to stop them. Little by little, the coach can introduce new elements that demand concentration, and most importantly from our point of view, integration of new information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can control a situation so that you can selectively increase the amount of information -- visual, auditory, spatial, or physical -- that you need to integrate to master a skill, then you will be able to learn anything in a smooth, steady manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what&#39;s it going to be in 2012?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Man Who Did His Tai Chi Form 19,100 Times</title>
      <link>/dankleiman.github.io/2011/12/28/the-man-who-did-his-tai-chi-form-19100-times/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 28 Dec 2011 07:58:25 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/dankleiman.github.io/2011/12/28/the-man-who-did-his-tai-chi-form-19100-times/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;&#34;&gt;I got an email the other day that was a little bit different than the usual requests for lessons. It read:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;&#34;&gt;&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;oelig;I learned the Short Form at Brookline Tai Chi under the tutelage of Bill Ryan back about 1996-1997. For seven years, I continued to do the short form three times every morning. Then for the past eight years or so, I have done the short form four times every morning.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;&#34;&gt;I keep a log of my centering practices, and have documentation that over the past 15 years, I have only missed doing my tai chi on three days, two when I was strapped down in hospital beds and unable to get up, and one day when I simply forgot to practice. (I practiced twice the next day.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;&#34;&gt;Thus, I have done the short form now over 17,800 times.&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;¬ù&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;&#34;&gt;There were so many things that fascinated me about getting this email. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;more&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;more-2966&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;&#34;&gt;First of all, it reinforced my belief that there&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;s no such thing as a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dankleiman.com/2010/12/01/brookline-tai-chi-has-no-former-students/&#34;&gt;&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;oelig;former student&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;¬ù&lt;/a&gt;. As a teacher, this was a powerful reminder that you don&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;t know the full extent of what you are giving your students and just how far they will take what they learn.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;&#34;&gt;Then, consider this:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;&#34;&gt;He practices tai chi every day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;&#34;&gt;He practices several repetitions of the short form every time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;&#34;&gt;He logs his practice every day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;&#34;&gt;As you know from reading this blog, I&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;m a little obsessed with the idea of &amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;oelig;practice.&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;¬ù Clearly this man knew something about cultivating a practice. I wanted to know more about what motivated him to practice daily and record it with such diligence. So I asked him, but I wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;t ready for the depth and thoughtfulness of his answer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignleft size-medium wp-image-3105&#34; title=&#34;Sandy Davis&#34; src=&#34;dankleiman.github.io/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0518-225x300.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Sandy Davis runs Resilience Works&#34; width=&#34;225&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;It turns out, I was talking to &amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;oelig;The Resilience Guy.&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;¬ù&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;&#34;&gt;Sandy Davis runs a company called &lt;a href=&#34;http://resilienceworks.com/&#34;&gt;ResilienceWorks&lt;/a&gt;, dedicated to teaching people how to become more resilient, or as he puts it:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&#34;CENTER&#34;&gt;&amp;Acirc; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: small;&#34;&gt;The more you invest wisely in your own vitality,&lt;br /&gt;
The more resilient you become, and&lt;br /&gt;
The easier it is to thrive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;&#34;&gt;Many of us come to movement arts like tai chi or qigong because of an innate desire to thrive, but Sandy has gone into great depth explaining the structures that make this process possible. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;&#34;&gt;He advocates for &amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;oelig;Seven Simple Self-Care Structures&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;¬ù that make this possible:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;&#34;&gt;Keep all your agreements.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;&#34;&gt;Eat well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;&#34;&gt;Sleep well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;&#34;&gt;Have a daily centering practice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;&#34;&gt;Exercise aerobically on a regular basis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;&#34;&gt;Have a daily creative practice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;&#34;&gt;Log your self-care results every day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;&#34;&gt;Now, when we talk about &amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;oelig;practice&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;¬ù here, we often talk about 3 or 4 of these structures (mainly centering, exercise, and sleep). We often imply that a lot of what grabs you about something like tai chi is the creative expression you derive from continually refining it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;&#34;&gt;And certainly we talk about tracking your practice -- although I haven&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;t yet met anyone else who has taken this habit to quite the same degree as Sandy -- he&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;s missed three days of practice in the last 14 years, and he can prove it!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;&#34;&gt;So what is it about &amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;oelig;keeping all your agreements&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;¬ù that adds to your store of energy? When I heard Sandy describe this particular structure, it broadened my sense of &amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;oelig;what builds your energy&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;¬ù and &amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;oelig;what uses up your energy&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;¬ù in a way I had never considered. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;&#34;&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.resilienceworks.com/resiliencemanual&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Resilience Manual&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; , Sandy&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;s guide to developing these structures, he writes:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;&#34;&gt;There is much satisfaction to be had in knowing that you are someone who can be relied upon to keep your word. By consistently walking your talk, &lt;strong&gt;you can acquire a deep-seated self-confidence in your ability to successfully follow through&lt;/strong&gt; on whatever you agree to undertake. This includes faithfully attending to your own foundational self-care habits, as well as to faithfully doing your chosen daily self-care practices.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;&#34;&gt;Alternatively, there is much disappointment to be had in knowing that you are someone who routinely fails to follow through on your commitments. Whenever you fail to keep your word, whenever you fail to do what you promised, whenever you do 95% of what you said you would do and leave the last 5% unfinished, in all these instances, you experience a loss of self-respect. Each of these failures, whether obvious and public, or miniscule and private, generates a measure of personal disappointment and/or discouragement. &lt;strong&gt;Such breakdowns cost you valuable energy. They undermine your self-confidence. And they get in the way of deepening your resilience-readiness. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;&#34;&gt;What I&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;ve highlighted in bold above should be familiar language when you think about your movement practice. You are either moving in a way that builds and integrates your coordination and your energy, or in a way that saps both and leads to dis-integration.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;&#34;&gt;Many of us have a gut feeling that how we cultivate a movement practice spills over into other dimensions of life, but I think Sandy has clearly articulated exactly how that works in the above passage. The lesson is that doing your movement practice won&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;t make you a better person, but &lt;em&gt;it is a template for how to move toward more wholeness in other areas of your life&lt;/em&gt;. In Sandy&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;s language, both structures feed your resilience-readiness and the store of resilience that you naturally draw energy from, no matter what situation you are facing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;&#34;&gt;The linchpin to all of this, from Sandy&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;s point of view, is the seventh structure, or the meta-structure of logging the results of the other six structures on a daily basis. In &lt;em&gt;The Resilience Manual,&lt;/em&gt; he makes several compelling arguments for keeping a daily practice log both to gain perspective and to sustain accountability to yourself. For me, the most compelling reason is the deep satisfaction this seventh structure generates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;&#34;&gt;A week or so after our lesson, Sandy e-mailed me to make a correction to the number of times he has done the short form (hence the title of this post):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;&#34;&gt;FYI, I re-checked the numbers, and it turns out that I have actually done the short form more than 19,100 times. It will be a treat to pass the 20,000 mark. At my current rate of four times each day, that will take me another seven-plus months. But who&#39;s counting?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;&#34;&gt;Think about how great that must feel to realize that you&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;re actually a little closer to 20,000? And not because you can brag about a number, but because you know you&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;ve made a serious ongoing investment in your own well-being.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;&#34;&gt;Big thanks to Sandy for sharing his method with so much clarity and simplicity! His website has more information, including some useful free resources and more in-depth explanations of the daily self-care structures. Check them out here: &lt;a href=&#34;http://resilienceworks.com/download.asp&#34;&gt;ResilienceWorks.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oh, and we also agreed that Sandy should come in for a tune-up every 3,000 forms, not every 10,000 or 15,000!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>4 Practice Partners You Should Avoid</title>
      <link>/dankleiman.github.io/2011/10/17/4-practice-partners-you-should-avoid/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 17 Oct 2011 08:29:22 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/dankleiman.github.io/2011/10/17/4-practice-partners-you-should-avoid/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The next time you go to class, watch out for these 4 practice partners. While they all start out with good intentions, if you hang out with them too much, you&#39;ll get sucked into their quirky habits and slow down your own progress. Don&#39;t say I didn&#39;t warn you!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a id=&#34;more&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;more-2278&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Checklist Charlie&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Checklist Charlie is the tai chi student who is forever stuck in his own head. Every time he practices, instead of feeling his body, he recites a list of stuff he is supposed to be doing. For most people, &#34;soundtracking&#34; your way through the form is a legitimate learning phase, but Checklist Charlie is stuck there forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;object width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; classid=&#34;clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000&#34; codebase=&#34;http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0&#34;&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowFullScreen&#34; value=&#34;true&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowscriptaccess&#34; value=&#34;always&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;src&#34; value=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/v/eaJebVBzufY?version=3&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;rel=0&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowfullscreen&#34; value=&#34;true&#34; /&gt;&lt;embed width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; type=&#34;application/x-shockwave-flash&#34; src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/v/eaJebVBzufY?version=3&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;rel=0&#34; allowFullScreen=&#34;true&#34; allowscriptaccess=&#34;always&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; /&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Intense Irene&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Intense Irene takes her practice way too far. At first, this is a good thing. She works hard and uncovers a lot of depth. Over time though, she goes too deeply into one thing and it distorts the rest of her practice, leaving her potentially injured, way too tense, and out of balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;object width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; classid=&#34;clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000&#34; codebase=&#34;http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0&#34;&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowFullScreen&#34; value=&#34;true&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowscriptaccess&#34; value=&#34;always&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;src&#34; value=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/v/HAIzvee9Ga4?version=3&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;rel=0&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowfullscreen&#34; value=&#34;true&#34; /&gt;&lt;embed width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; type=&#34;application/x-shockwave-flash&#34; src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/v/HAIzvee9Ga4?version=3&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;rel=0&#34; allowFullScreen=&#34;true&#34; allowscriptaccess=&#34;always&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; /&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Workshop Wally&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Workshop Wally loves to collect pieces of his practice, like random pieces from a bunch of different puzzles. When he tries to fit them all together, it&#39;s a total disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;object width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; classid=&#34;clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000&#34; codebase=&#34;http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0&#34;&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowFullScreen&#34; value=&#34;true&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowscriptaccess&#34; value=&#34;always&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;src&#34; value=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/v/GfKb18GTeoQ?version=3&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;rel=0&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowfullscreen&#34; value=&#34;true&#34; /&gt;&lt;embed width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; type=&#34;application/x-shockwave-flash&#34; src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/v/GfKb18GTeoQ?version=3&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;rel=0&#34; allowFullScreen=&#34;true&#34; allowscriptaccess=&#34;always&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; /&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Environmental Ernie&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m not talking about your &#34;greenest&#34; student, I&#39;m talking about the one with no internal motivation to practice. Environmental Ernie relies on the external environment, fellow students, regular classes, instructor-led sessions, to do his practice. And I think that&#39;s fine! We can all learn from his laid-back ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;object width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; classid=&#34;clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000&#34; codebase=&#34;http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0&#34;&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowFullScreen&#34; value=&#34;true&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowscriptaccess&#34; value=&#34;always&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;src&#34; value=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/v/ueAUIXDyVdE?version=3&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;rel=0&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowfullscreen&#34; value=&#34;true&#34; /&gt;&lt;embed width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; type=&#34;application/x-shockwave-flash&#34; src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/v/ueAUIXDyVdE?version=3&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;rel=0&#34; allowFullScreen=&#34;true&#34; allowscriptaccess=&#34;always&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; /&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Kilimanjaro Made Easy</title>

      <pubDate>Thu, 15 Sep 2011 10:05:27 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/dankleiman.github.io/2011/09/15/kilimanjaro-made-easy/</guid>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignleft size-medium wp-image-2151&#34; title=&#34;Jen on Kilimanjaro&#34; src=&#34;dankleiman.github.io/uploads/2011/09/P1010499-300x225.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;225&#34; /&gt;Z-Health Master Trainer Jen Waak is a self-described &#34;recovering management consultant&#34;. These days, she helps other &#34;Keyboard Athletes&#34; improve and maintain their bodies and stay healthy even when they&#39;re stuck behind a desk all day. What surprised me about reading Jen&#39;s advice on &#34;what you should do at your desk&#34;, was that it sounded a lot like what she did last year to get ready for a climb up Mount Kilimanjaro.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a id=&#34;more&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;more-1999&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here&#39;s what Jen had to say about her prep and training:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It was a year ago today that I left to climb Kilimanjaro. I&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;m not a climber, I don&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;t camp, and I don&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;t like the cold. So why I thought this was a good idea I&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;ll never know. I just knew it was something I needed to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I got over the &amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;oelig;what have I done?&#34; stage, it was time to start figuring out what it would take to summit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I started researching the trip, and here is what I learned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;40% of climbers don&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;t make the summit, and the vast majority of the succumb to hypoxia (altitude sickness) since a summit of 19,340 feet means there is about half of the oxygen at the summit than there is at sea level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was going to be traveling ~60 very hilly miles on foot over 9 days. No one day was going to be the gotcha &amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&#34; instead it was going to be the accumulated miles that would wear down my body.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being comfortable in your gear is critically important since what you have with you is, well, what you have with you. And there&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;s nothing like getting blisters and only 59 more miles to go.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In a situation like this, it would be really easy to get freaked out and not know where to start. But, using a framework I call the Energy Bank, I was able to fairly easily come up with a extremely doable training plan that made summiting downright easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Energy Bank&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Energy Bank is this idea that we all have a finite amount of energy to get through the day, and everything we do during the day &amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&#34;&amp;Acirc; everything &amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&#34;&amp;Acirc; either adds to or depletes our bank balance: the lighting in the room, your breathing patterns, the horrible morning commute, your uncomfortable desk chair, and that grande burrito you had for lunch. It all has an impact. And just like a bank balance the higher the average balance, the larger the margin of error before going bankrupt. As you can imagine, a large margin of error will serve someone well when attempting one of the Seven Summits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my goal in preparing for Kilimanjaro was to get my Energy Bank Balance high enough so that the trip wouldn&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;t run the balance down to zero &amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&#34; focusing specifically on what I would encounter on the trip that would be more likely to result in large withdrawals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Training for the Climb&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Breathing:&lt;/strong&gt; I knew this was already a weak link for me - and given that it&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;s also the downfall of most climbers, this became my #1 priority. My first goal was to fix my breathing patterns at sea level during everyday activities. Once I had that mastered, I went on to practicing my breathing while in oxygen debt (as ultimately that was what I would encounter on Kilimanjaro). Since I live at sea level, I couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;t truly replicate the conditions on Kilimanjaro, but instead would sprint or run stairs and focus on my breathing during and after those activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vision:&lt;/strong&gt; Another one of my weak links, I spent a great deal of time working on my visual skills. My depth perception isn&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;t great, which translates into me being tentative going down stairs. Since I had to travel 60 miles over hilly terrain, not being comfortable going up and down was going to be a BIG problem. So, I incorporated some basic convergence drills into my training so my eyes could re-learn to focus and my brain would re-learn depth perception. Like my breathing, first I worked on this during everyday activities, and then I moved on to working it into my running stairs, long hikes, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Endurance:&lt;/strong&gt; Going and going over 9 days on rough terrain was something I didn&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;t have any experience in. Using the Energy Bank concept, I realized that if my body was already somewhat adapted to that it would be a lot easier. But, with a hectic schedule and living in the city, I couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;t exactly take off for 9 days to climb in the Cascades. Instead, I got the idea that if fatigued my legs the night before a long hike with either a run or stair session, that I would begin the adaptation process of going long distances on tired legs. So, I would either do a long stair session or a run one night and then the next morning go and hike 10+ miles with a 3,000 foot elevation gain (since that would most replicate the conditions I&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;d find on Kilimanjaro). I got in probably 3 or 4 of these back-to-back training sessions prior to Kilimanjaro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gear:&lt;/strong&gt; Remember that part where I said I don&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;t climb or camp? Yeah, that meant that I had a buy and test a TON of gear for the trip. In the weeks leading up to the climb my week would look something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go on a hike, discover I didn&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;t have the right gear (either through blisters, sweating sunscreen into my eyes, or dealing with lots of bugs. I&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;d come home and take notes on what worked and what didn&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to REI and pick up what I was missing (and just cover my eyes while signing the credit card receipt)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go on another hike and re-assess. Lather, rinse, repeat until I knew I had what I needed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Overkill? Maybe. But I had no blisters, no chafing, and at no point did I say, &amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;oelig;I wish I would have brought&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;brvbar;&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;¬ù&amp;Acirc;  Everything got tested on at least one 10+ mile hike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recovery:&lt;/strong&gt; Early on in my physical training I got a bit ambitious and decided to run 4 miles down a mountain. That turned out to be one of the less bright things I could have done, as I couldn&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;t go up and down stairs for several days after that. But it also highlighted something I hadn&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;t considered &amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&#34; that I could get sore. A phone call to fellow Master Trainer and endurance athlete Shannon Mauck revealed the world of recovery drinks to me. Yet another thing for me to test &amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&#34;&amp;Acirc; I needed to find something that I both liked the taste of and that would agree with my system. (Turns out I really like Accelerade.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did it Work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;d have to give the entire experiment an unqualified, &amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;oelig;hell, yeah.&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;¬ù&amp;Acirc;  My training wasn&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;t extreme &amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&#34;&amp;Acirc; I did 6 long hikes and then a couple of hours of running, sprinting, and stairs per week. I worked on my breathing and vision for a few minutes a day, and made a point of incorporating that practice while on my long hikes. And the entire trip up the mountain was a piece of cake for me &amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&#34;&amp;Acirc; I&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;d get into camp each night with extra energy to burn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The biggest surprise:&lt;/strong&gt; The mental shift in who I am. I grew up a really sick little kid, and had never considered myself an athlete. And now I had accomplished that thousands of people cannot each year. I had to redefine who I am, and now think of myself as an athlete. Because everything is a skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you liked the way she managed her mountain climbing training, you&#39;ll definitely be interested in her insight into bringing more energy into your daily life: &lt;a href=&#34;http://keyboardathletes.com/yourenergybank/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Increase Your Energy Bank Balance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>30 Day Better Breathing Challenge</title>
      <link>/dankleiman.github.io/2011/07/04/30-day-better-breathing-challenge/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Jul 2011 10:17:51 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/dankleiman.github.io/2011/07/04/30-day-better-breathing-challenge/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I&#39;ve been talking a lot about two things, &lt;a title=&#34;Follow the 20-20-20 Rule for Better Breathing&#34; href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/2011/05/21/follow-the-20-20-20-rule-for-better-breathing/&#34;&gt;improving your breathing&lt;/a&gt; to give you a &lt;a title=&#34;Disrupt the Stress Cycle with Better Breathing&#34; href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/2011/05/26/disrupt-the-stress-cycle-with-better-breathing/&#34;&gt;major energy/relaxation boost&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a title=&#34;Building Better Practice Tools&#34; href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/2011/05/16/building-better-practice-tools/&#34;&gt;developing tools&lt;/a&gt; that help you &lt;a href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/?p=1494&#34;&gt;follow-through on your home practice&lt;/a&gt;. I&#39;ve even created an online course with all the information you need to cultivate better breathing habits: &lt;a title=&#34;Better Breathing&#34; href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/courses/better-breathing/&#34;&gt;Better Breathing&lt;/a&gt;. The biggest lesson we learned as we talked to BTC students&amp;Acirc;  was that the best time to use reminders to trigger your practice was when you were invested in learning a new skill.&lt;a id=&#34;more&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;more-1510&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; When you&#39;re going through a period of sustained practice, integrating stuff you&#39;ve learned before, you need external tools less. However, when you shift back into learning mode and set a specific training goal, getting extra, regular motivation from an outside source can push you over the line from wanting to learn something to ingraining it as a habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning to cultivate better breathing habits is a great example of skill building that benefits from extra stimulation. As I explain in the breathing course, there is a clear threshold with your breathing practice that you need to cross to make a lasting impact on your habits. In one sense, the secret to mastering better breathing habits is just putting in the time. The steps along the path to better breathing aren&#39;t always exciting or immediately gratifying, but crossing the breathing threshold puts you into a different world where:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;each breath feels deep and nourishing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;your insides feel smooth and relaxed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you radiate a sense of well-being and easy-to-sustain energy throughout your day&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
These are the kinds of things you only notice once you&#39;ve had them and lost them. The biggest challenge of cultivating these qualities is that you can&#39;t do it in one single act of will power. You need sustained, regular practice to take you over the threshold. The good news is that you can leverage external tools, instead of just will power, to carry you over the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&#39;s why I&#39;ve created the 30 Day Breathing Challenge. If you want to hit a new depth of practice in the next month, I will give you the tools to get there. For a limited time, I&#39;m giving away my online breathing course (normally $29), for free. All you have to do is sign-up for the 30-Day Challenge using the form below. I will send you daily practice reminders and weekly video instruction drawn from the course. In 30 days, you&#39;re going to see a major shift in your personal practice. Ready?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://eepurl.com/xORb&#34;&gt;Sign up for the 30 Day Challenge here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>10 Things Modern Athletes Can Learn from the Tai Chi Classics</title>
      <link>/dankleiman.github.io/2011/06/27/10-things-modern-athletes-can-learn-from-the-tai-chi-classics/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Jun 2011 09:58:46 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/dankleiman.github.io/2011/06/27/10-things-modern-athletes-can-learn-from-the-tai-chi-classics/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;By training the principles of body-alignment and movement as described in the Tai Chi Classics, you can move with much more grace, fluidity, and power. Instead of wasting energy holding excess tension, relaxation can lead the way to more powerful movement. Here&#39;s what Yang Cheng-fu said about it a hundred years ago (the following is adapted from YANG&#39;S TEN IMPORTANT POINTS by Yang  Cheng-fu (1883 &amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&#34; 1936) as researched by Lee N. Scheele and published on  http://www.scheele.org/lee/classics.html. Scheele&#39;s translation is first and my notes are in italics following):&lt;a id=&#34;more&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;more-1581&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.) Head upright to let the shen [spirit of vitality] rise to the top of the head.&lt;/strong&gt; Don&#39;t use li [external strength], or the neck will be stiff and the ch&#39;i [vital life energy] and blood cannot flow through. It is necessary to have a natural and lively feeling. If the spirit cannot reach the headtop, it cannot raise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you&#39;re sitting at your computer right now, what do your head and neck feel like? The beginning of effortless posture is how you hold your head. As it collapses down and forward, you begin a stress-inducing cascade of neck and shoulder pain, poor breathing, and bad posture.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.) Sink the chest and pluck up the back.&lt;/strong&gt; The chest is depressed naturally inward so that the ch&#39;i can sink to the tan-t&#39;ien [field of elixir]. Don&#39;t expand the chest: the ch&#39;i gets stuck there and the body becomes top-heavy. The heel will be too light and can be uprooted. Pluck up the back and the ch&#39;i sticks to the back; depress the chest and you can pluck up the back. Then you can discharge force through the spine. You will be a peerless boxer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here&#39;s another posture tip. Lengthen the spine. It&#39;s the opposite of &amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;oelig;fetal position&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;¬ù fight or flight response (again, think stress). When you keep the chest relaxed and sunk, you naturally begin to breathe deeply with the diaphragm, getting a more efficient breath and actually nourishing the internal organs, literally massaging them with internal pressure changes. This is all the opposite of what happens to breath and posture when you hyperventilate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; 3.) Sung [Relax] the waist.&lt;/strong&gt; The waist is the commander of the whole body. If you can sung the waist, then the two legs will have power and the lower part will be firm and stable. Substantial and insubstantial change, and this is based on the turning of the waist. It is said &#34;the source of the postures lies in the waist. If you cannot get power, seek the defect in the legs and waist.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now we&#39;re getting into some more esoteric terminology, but as a tai chi teacher, I&#39;ve found that many of my students have frozen hips. Start there. If you can&#39;t distinguish the movement of the legs, pelvis, and trunk, then your source of power and movement is seriously diminished. You should be able to internally and externally rotate each leg independently of hip movement and roll the pelvis around without moving the spine or legs. Once you can move all these parts independently, you can learn to lead movements with hip drive and powerful rotation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; 4.) Differentiate between insubstantial and substantial.&lt;/strong&gt; This is the first principle in T&#39;ai Chi Ch&#39;uan. If the weight of the whole body is resting on the right leg, then the right leg is substantial and the left leg is insubstantial, and vice versa. When you can separate substantial and insubstantial, you can turn lightly without using strength. If you cannot separate, the step is heavy and slow. The stance is not firm and can be easily thrown of balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ever see someone get caught &amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;oelig;flat-footed&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;¬ù on the court? The ability to distinguish where your weight is by feel, and quickly shift your center of gravity left and right is critical for reaction speed and movement. In tai chi, you learn to make this distinction completely clearly in slow motion, and then you gradually increase the speed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; 5.) Sink the shoulders and drop the elbows.&lt;/strong&gt; The shoulders will be completely relaxed and open. If you cannot relax and sink, the two shoulders will be raised up and tense. The ch&#39;i will follow them up and the whole body cannot get power. &#34;Drop the elbows&#34; means the elbows go down and relax. If the elbows raise, the shoulders are not able to sink and you cannot discharge people far. The discharge will then be close to the broken force of the external schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This principle has to do with power-generation in tai chi, and may not be completely adaptable to your sport, but I will point this out: whenever you are in motion and you feel your shoulders start to creep towards your ears, you&#39;re experiencing the beginning of that fight or flight response. By training the physical opposite, you are sending your body the message that relaxation in motion is possible, and you&#39;re getting better at maintaining it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; 6.) Use the mind instead of force.&lt;/strong&gt; The T&#39;ai Chi Ch&#39;uan Classics say, &#34;all of this means use I [mind-intent] and not li.&#34; In practicing T&#39;ai Chi Ch&#39;uan the whole body relaxes. Don&#39;t let one ounce of force remain in the blood vessels, bones, and ligaments to tie yourself up. Then you can be agile and able to change. You will be able to turn freely and easily. Doubting this, how can you increase your power?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The body has meridians like the ground has ditches and trenches. If not obstructed the water can flow. If the meridian is not closed, the ch&#39;i goes through. If the whole body has hard force and it fills up the meridians, the ch&#39;i and the blood stop and the turning is not smooth and agile. Just pull one hair and the whole body is off-balance. If you use I, and not li, then the I goes to a place in the body and the ch&#39;i follows it. The ch&#39;i and the blood circulate. If you do this every day and never stop, after a long time you will have nei chin [real internal strength]. The T&#39;ai Chi Ch&#39;uan Classics say, &#34;when you are extremely soft, you become extremely hard and strong.&#34; Someone who has extremely good T&#39;ai Chi Ch&#39;uan kung fu has arms like iron wrapped with cotton and the weight is very heavy. As for the external schools, when they use li, they reveal li. When they don&#39;t use li, they are too light and floating. There chin is external and locked together. The li of the external schools is easily led and moved, and not too be esteemed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When he refers to &amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;oelig;force&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;¬ù or &amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;oelig;li&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;¬ù in this principle, you should read it as &amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;oelig;extra&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;¬ù or &amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;oelig;unnecessary tension&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;¬ù. Too many people have a silly fantasy about tai chi relying on magical chi and no force as an excuse for not training hard. The way you get to effortless power in tai chi is by refining you movements, stripping them of unnecessary tension, layer by layer. You do tai chi in slow motion so that your mind can search every inch of your insides and find the extra tension that is holding back your movements.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7.) Coordinate the upper and lower parts of the body.&lt;/strong&gt; The T&#39;ai Chi Ch&#39;uan Classics say &#34;the motion should be rooted in the feet, released through the legs, controlled by the waist and manifested through the fingers.&#34; Everything acts simultaneously. When the hand, waist and foot move together, the eyes follow. If one part doesn&#39;t follow, the whole body is disordered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This description of force generation, coming from the ground and going up through the body and out the fingers is almost word for word how Curt Schilling described throwing a perfect pitch. Again, think of the basic practices of tai chi, the slow motion form work, as awareness training that lets you pay attention to these connections in a way you wouldn&#39;t be able to always going fast. Take any movement from your sport and try it in slow motion. Can you find these links?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8.) Harmonize the internal and external.&lt;/strong&gt; In the practice of T&#39;ai Chi Ch&#39;uan the main thing is the shen. Therefore it is said &#34;the spirit is the commander and the body is subordinate.&#34; If you can raise the spirit, then the movements will naturally be agile. The postures are not beyond insubstantial and substantial, opening and closing. That which is called open means not only the hands and feet are open, but the mind is also open. That which is called closed means not only the hands and feet are closed, but the mind is also closed. When you can make the inside and outside become one, then it becomes complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You hear people describe moments of flow, when time slows down, or the ball or the net looks huge and making the shot was inevitable. These moments are perfect examples of the inside and the outside becoming one. When the mind opens up and the internal and external are harmonized, you access a different kind of awareness. Tai Chi actually includes a systematic training method for getting you into that state, again and again.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9.) Move with continuity.&lt;/strong&gt; As to the external schools, their chin is the Latter Heaven brute chin. Therefore it is finite. There are connections and breaks. During the breaks the old force is exhausted and the new force has not yet been born. At these moments it is very easy for others to take advantage. T&#39;ai Chi Ch&#39;uan uses I and not li. From beginning to end it is continuous and not broken. It is circular and again resumes. It revolves and has no limits. The original Classics say it is &#34;like a great river rolling on unceasingly.&#34; and that the circulation of the chin is &#34;drawing silk from a cocoon &#34; They all talk about being connected together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Try this exercise: with your index finger, draw a box in front of you and keep going around, with sharp corners and edges. Try to pay attention to your breathing at the same time. Now compare that to what it feels like to make a circle with your finger. See how much easier it is to tune into your breathing doing circular movement? Feel how the stop and start of linear movement briefly &amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;oelig;freezes&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;¬ù your nervous system as you change directions. It&#39;s this simple practice of circular movement, repeated on deeper and deeper levels, that is the key to relaxation in tai chi.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10.) Move with tranquility [Seek stillness in movement].&lt;/strong&gt; The external schools assume jumping about is good and they use all their energy. That is why after practice everyone pants. T&#39;ai Chi Ch&#39;uan uses stillness to control movement. Although one moves, there is also stillness. Therefore in practicing the form, slower is better. If it is slow, the inhalation and exhalation are long and deep and the ch&#39;i sinks to the tan-t&#39;ien. Naturally there is no injurious practice such as engorgement of the blood vessels. The learner should be careful to comprehend it. Then you will get the real meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Often, when people start learning tai chi, they think &amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;oelig;ok, I&#39;m going to get this right&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;¬ù, as if doing the movement perfectly once was the end goal and they could stop there. That&#39;s the completely wrong way to think about it. In tai chi, you are setting up a state or a condition where all of the postural alignments, layers of relaxation, and continuity of movement can gel. Your goal is to experience that state, returning to it again and again, &amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;oelig;seeking stillness in movement&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;¬ù. Daily practice, when you enter this state, becomes a major recharge and even when you are doing tai chi as a way to get better at something else, the nourishing, refreshing experience of doing the practice slowly becomes the goal itself. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>DIY Home Practice Challenge</title>
      <link>/dankleiman.github.io/2011/06/06/diy-home-practice-challenge/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 06 Jun 2011 13:19:25 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/dankleiman.github.io/2011/06/06/diy-home-practice-challenge/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;From the recent practice survey we conducted at Brookline Tai Chi and experiments I&#39;ve been running in online learning, it&#39;s become clearer and clearer to me that most people need some external motivation when they are learning a new skill. That&#39;s not a judgment about willpower and motivation, it actually says more about the way we are wired for survival. &lt;a id=&#34;more&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;more-1523&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In Z Health, we always talk about the way that the nervous system is at once the most plastic system -- it can adapt to lots of different changes -- and also the most stable. The stability of the nervous system is a good thing from a survival and energy management point of view -- it doesn&#39;t cost you a lot of cognitive energy to get through your day if you run on habit. In that sense, the plasticity of the nervous system -- your ability to change and learn new things -- has to deal with the inertia of stability in your nervous system. When we are trying to learn new behaviors and forge new habits, these two things can be at odds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I&#39;ve seen and heard from my tai chi students, is that a little bit of external motivation goes a long way to spark the small changes you need to make on a daily basis to put new behavior in place. Last week, one of my students said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was liberating to think that 5 minutes of tai chi practice meant I could make progress, because until I thought about it that way, I avoided practice, assuming it was going to take 30 minutes or more.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In fact, if you look at some studies on mental rehearsal and brain function, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1580438,00.html&#34;&gt;like this one&lt;/a&gt;, you start to see that the cognitive component of learning new skills can be practiced in a much easier way than devoting hours and hours of grueling practice -- time that very few people I work with have to spare anyway. The smarter you get about your practice, the better you&#39;ll get at getting good at new things!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here&#39;s my DIY Home Practice Challenge for you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drill down into your practice until you get to a small chunk you can practice in 5 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick the easiest time of day to devote to your practice -- what&#39;s the perfect scenario for practicing this skill&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set a recurring reminder in your calendar -- pick the medium that will be most accessible to get the reminder at the right time, i.e. on your desktop to interrupt your work, via email, or even text message&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each day when you get the reminder, do your 5 minute practice, and then maybe take a minute or two to reflect on the success of what you just did or refine the scenario if necessary&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You will fail to build up this practice habit if:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You pick too big a skill to work on, e.g. I want to become a ballerina&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are vague about when you are going to do it, e.g. I will practice it daily&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You don&#39;t get the reminder at the right time, e.g. I&#39;ll practice at noon each day, but my reminder comes in at 6pm&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I know those failures might sound obvious, and you should pick something pretty simple and obvious to begin with, but what I hope is that once you see the power in this simple approach, you&#39;ll start to tackle more complex and exciting skill building and begin to reflect on a lot of different experiences, in business, at work, in personal relationships, with the same desire to make incremental progress as you do with a hobby or healthy habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m always curious to hear how this goes for people, so send me an email or drop a comment below once you get set up and start hitting your daily targets.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Decoding Student Practice Habits</title>
      <link>/dankleiman.github.io/2011/05/30/decoding-student-practice-habits/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 30 May 2011 08:10:30 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/dankleiman.github.io/2011/05/30/decoding-student-practice-habits/</guid>
      <description>&lt;img class=&#34;alignleft&#34; title=&#34;Donkey Kong from Arcade-Musuem.com&#34; src=&#34;http://www.arcade-museum.com/images/118/1181242103213.png&#34; alt=&#34;The Donkey Kong Model of Learning&#34; height=&#34;256&#34; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the heck does Donkey Kong have to do with the practice habits of tai chi students? It turns out the ladders and platforms in the video game are a perfect model for understanding the ecosystem of students practice habits. Let me explain the survey design and then I&#39;ll share some really fascinating results about how people engage Brookline Tai Chi to develop their tai chi practice.&lt;a id=&#34;more&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;more-1494&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Survey Design&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Last week we conducted a small practice survey to try to get a more accurate picture of what students do outside of class. We sent out a request to participate to about 2000 people on our email list, and 30 completed the survey in detail. I then divided the 30 into 3 groups, to test the difference between two types of daily reminders and a weekly follow-up. The initial survey, sent on a Sunday, asked people about &#34;typical&#34; practice habits: frequency, duration, and content. I followed up on Friday with the same set of questions, but instead of asking what people &#34;typically&#34; practice, I asked them what they specifically practiced &#34;last week&#34;. In between the initial Sunday survey and the follow-up Friday survey, 1/3 of participants received a daily email that said &#34;Thanks again for volunteering to help us develop better practice tools for our tai chi community. I&#39;m going to send you a little practice reminder every day this week and ask you about it at the end of the week. So...take a few minutes today to do some practice!&#34;. Another third got a similar email, but it included a link to a one-question survey: &#34;what did you practice today?&#34; The last third only got the Sunday and Friday surveys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who Participated in the Survey&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Now, in this case, we actually know just about everyone who participated in the survey, but that&#39;s a good thing. We&#39;re not trying to run a randomized, controlled, double-blinded study. We&#39;re trying to gain deeper insight into our students&#39; experience and develop tools for them that makes the practice more rewarding. So who participated?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some people were relatively new to learning tai chi and chi gung&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some people have been doing home practice for 15 years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some people attend classes 3-5 times per week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some people don&#39;t live nearby the school or in Massachusetts (but they were tuned in enough to what we do to complete this survey, hmmm)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I was really excited to see that we got such a range of people interested in participating in this experience. It speaks to richness of our community that the request to &#34;help us develop better practice tools&#34; was embraced by people with so many different relationships to the school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the results started coming in, it looked to me that people fell into a few distinct categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Home Practicers vs. School Practicers vs. Blended Practice People&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skill Acquisition Mode vs. Practice Plateau Mode&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
There was also a category of what I think of now as &#34;Super Practicers&#34;. Whereas most people reported on practice frequency as a number of days, these folks said &#34;daily&#34;. As I watched their survey results come in and read how they talked about their practice, it was clear that their practice is so ingrained into their lives, that practicing for them is just like eating or breathing. Surprisingly, the amount of time the Super Practicers reported varied from 10 minutes to 2 hours. It wasn&#39;t like the 10 minute Super Practicer was yearning to be in the 2 hour category, though. It was just that 10 minutes a day makes perfect sense for the role practice plays in their life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Skill Ladders and Practice Platforms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Ok, so here&#39;s where the Donkey Kong Model comes in. It was very clear that the students we surveyed fell into two different groups, which roughly matched up to how long they had been in their practice, but not completely. Some of the participants were actively engaged in learning new material, which is usually the choreography of a tai chi or chi gung set. The folks in this category who received daily email reminders to practice did more practice during the week than they thought they typically do. The folks in this category who only got the end-of-week follow-up did less practice than they reported initially.&lt;strong&gt; It seems clear from these results that when you are on the ladder of new skill acquisition, daily practice triggers help you get there faster.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, we have the people who are maintaining a regular, ongoing practice. For these folks, there was almost no change in reported practice, whether they received daily emails or the weekly survey. To these people, the reminders were more of an annoyance (they told me so!). The conclusion here isn&#39;t that the tool is not useful, it&#39;s that these folks don&#39;t need an external reminder to perform something that is internally motivated. More importantly, seeing very little change in the Practice Plateau group highlighted the impact of the daily reminders on the Skill Acquisition group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Donkey King Model is useful here, because over the course of your lifetime of practice, you don&#39;t just go through one Skill Acquisition Phase and one Practice Plateau. I like that image from the game of hanging out on a platform for a while, at a certain level of practice, before you embark on another climb up the skill ladder. From my own experience as a student and as a teacher, I think this is much more common. My intuition is that the daily reminder tool could be refined, if it&#39;s goal-specific enough, to be useful to anyone who is in a Skill Acquisition Phase, not just complete beginners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where Does Motivation Come From?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Where does motivation come from? I don&#39;t actually know for sure, but we learned some really interesting stuff about how people construct their practice. There seems to be a spectrum from internal to external sources of motivation. Again, this often correlated to how long people have been doing the practice, but not completely. Here&#39;s what I mean: when people first walk through the door to learn chi gung or tai chi, they need external motivation: they don&#39;t have the right information yet, they don&#39;t know what to practice, and they don&#39;t have any practice habits yet (for this art).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you climb one or two skill ladders, you start to feel the benefits of practice. You no longer practice &#34;because my doctor told me to&#34; or because &#34;I saw people doing it in the parks in China&#34;. Instead, the practice starts to satisfy you on some level. At this point, we see some branching. There are a small number of people who take one course and then go off and practice on their own forever. To me, they&#39;ve abandoned all of the external motivation we can provide, and made regular practice 100% internally driven. More often we see students who are happy to have the social support of classmates, a physical place to practice, and the guidance of an instructor -- all external motivators --- to keep their practice going. Many slot into this relationship with the school indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of our instructors tells a funny story where a friend of hers, on hearing that she&#39;s been coming to classes for 15 years, said &#34;Don&#39;t you know it already?&#34; That&#39;s a perfect example of assuming that long term practice is one big skill ladder to climb. It&#39;s not. The practice plateaus along the way are not the same as the linear climb to skill acquisition and part of what a community like Brookline Tai Chi offers is not only external motivation, but external connection -- to people and a place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any progress we make developing practice tools for our students will have to consider all of these factors, internal and external motivators, phases of skill acquisition and even the satisfaction of practice plateaus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That brings me to the most surprising result in our survey. Many of the participants fell into the Super Practicer category, with extremely high internal motivation to practice, and in some cases no immediate geographic proximity to the school. By all appearances, this is the group who has moved on from everything we have to offer -- weekly classes, skill ladders, a space, people to practice with, instructor feedback . So why did so many of these folks respond to a request to develop practice tools for our community? In one sense, they appear to be the least connected to the day-to-day activities of the school and the least in need of help with practice, but they all responded to our request and gave a tremendous amount of insight into their practice habits. It&#39;s going to be a huge payoff for me when we finally figure out what makes these folks tick.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Building Better Practice Tools</title>
      <link>/dankleiman.github.io/2011/05/16/building-better-practice-tools/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 16 May 2011 09:20:57 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/dankleiman.github.io/2011/05/16/building-better-practice-tools/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m running a little experiment right now at Brookline Tai Chi to see if we can help our students develop better home practice habits. Specifically, I&#39;m experimenting with self-reporting and automated reminders to spark daily practice sessions outside of class.&lt;a id=&#34;more&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;more-1438&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, when I talk to other people in our international tai chi community, I realize what a powerful practice aid Brookline Tai Chi already is. What I mean is, the bricks-and-mortar experience of coming to the school and being around other people removes so many barriers people have to doing tai chi. It sounds too obvious to mention, but that is exactly why participating at the school is such a powerful way to build a practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this project, though, I&#39;m experimenting with email reminders and surveys to get an initial feel for what people do outside of class. I want to see if I can help them trigger more practice sessions during the week. From the initial self-reporting, it also appears that there are many daily practicers already, so I also want to see if there is a systematic way to help them shape their practice and get more out of it. Hopefully, this is the beginning of a longer conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not going to explain the experiment in detail just yet, because I want people to go through it without too much bias, but I&#39;ll share the results here once we know what we&#39;ve found. Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Health Month Wrap-Up</title>
      <link>/dankleiman.github.io/2011/03/29/health-month-wrap-up/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 29 Mar 2011 14:48:03 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/dankleiman.github.io/2011/03/29/health-month-wrap-up/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As March comes to an end, I&#39;m wrapping up playing &lt;a href=&#34;http://healthmonth.com&#34;&gt;Health Month&lt;/a&gt;, an online game that helps you integrate new habits and change behavior. Here&#39;s my review of Health Month and a recap of what I experienced. I have to say, I don&#39;t think I really explored it to the fullest, but there were a couple of things I really liked about it and a couple of things I didn&#39;t connect with in the design.&lt;a id=&#34;more&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;more-789&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, what didn&#39;t really work for me, then what I really like about this tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Point System&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Each day when you &#34;play your turn&#34;, you get a number of points for the rules you follow (set up at the beginning of the month) and lose points for the ones you don&#39;t. My problem was, the points didn&#39;t really have meaning for me. What was much more valuable for me was recognizing the connection between following the rules and how I felt, both in terms of succeeding in the task of following them, and in terms of how healthier habits made me feel physically. More on this below...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Social Aspect&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Now, you are supposed to be able to regain points and be held accountable by interacting with other people. I never connected in to this layer of the game, so it was hard to put weight behind the points or more public accountability. Maybe if I had started playing with someone I already knew, I would have found this aspect more compelling. It&#39;s probably pretty necessary to make these connections right away and I think there are ways to find people with similar rules or goals. I just never pulled the trigger on this piece of it because I wanted to ease into playing, but a couple of weeks in, I think not having that social pressure made it easier for me to ignore the game more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Having a Month&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I really like that the time frame is set as a month, for two reasons. First, the reset is right around the corner. Every month is a fresh start if you really get off track. Second, setting a goal for a behavior over a span like 30 days is much more manageable than saying you want to do something &#34;from now on&#34;, or as they call it at the Stanford Persuasive Technology Lab, adopting a &#34;Path Behavior&#34;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s an explanation of the Fogg Behavior Model:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;object classid=&#34;clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000&#34; width=&#34;425&#34; height=&#34;349&#34; codebase=&#34;http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0&#34;&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowFullScreen&#34; value=&#34;true&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowscriptaccess&#34; value=&#34;always&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;src&#34; value=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/v/VqqJOMcd2zI?fs=1&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;rel=0&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowfullscreen&#34; value=&#34;true&#34; /&gt;&lt;embed type=&#34;application/x-shockwave-flash&#34; width=&#34;425&#34; height=&#34;349&#34; src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/v/VqqJOMcd2zI?fs=1&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;rel=0&#34; allowscriptaccess=&#34;always&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s interesting though, that Dr. Fogg recently tweeted this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/#!/bjfogg/status/35456115961638912&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Our data shows: People want to achieve Path Behaviors most. But they should really focus on Span Behaviors. www.behaviorgrid.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The difference between a &#34;span&#34; behavior and a &#34;path&#34; behavior is duration. &#34;From now on&#34; is too indefinite for most people to really master. When you limit the change you are aiming for to one month, though, you are creating a more manageable goal.&amp;Acirc;  Health Month makes you shoot for &#34;span&#34; behaviors by design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using Rules&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
There was something that really clicked for me about formulating my Health Month goals as rules. Rules guide you from vague goals into concrete actions. I had to think through weekly situations and envision when I was going to follow my rules. The rules had to be crafted in ways I could reasonably follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a golden mean between doing things differently and doing them in a sustainable way. Fast changes, where you try to re-shape everything in your life, don&#39;t work. Imagine waking up one morning and deciding that your are going to do everything different, eat, exercise, work, interact. You can&#39;t do it. Part of that has to do with how weak our willpower really is. When you have to exercise a lot of self-control, you literally drain energy from your cognitive abilities (Chip and Dan Heath go through great examples of this and the concept of visualizing habits you want to ingrain ahead of time in &lt;a href=&#34;http://heathbrothers.com/switch/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Switch&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the other extreme is not changing at all or changing the wrong things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that most of what you do should be driven by habit. That&#39;s the most efficient way to do things. But, you have to be thoughtful about the habits you want to create in life, and work hard at the systems and practices that are going to develop the habits you want. It&#39;s a strange mindset, I know. The cognitive work is in building the systems. Leave the rest to your nervous system&#39;s natural ability to adapt and make habits. I think Health Month helped me see this more clearly and I look forward to &#34;playing by the rules&#34; now even more!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m pretty excited to try this one out. Health Month is a behavior change game where you set rules to follow each month and do daily tracking, with rewards and penalties for how well you follow them. I&#39;m just digging into it, but so far it looks like you can choose &#34;do more of this&#34; or &#34;do less of that&#34;.&lt;a id=&#34;more&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;more-638&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I like the idea of limiting the scope of the goal to a month (what BJ Fogg calls a &#34;span&#34; behavior instead of a &#34;path&#34; behavior -- and says the key to long term change is focusing on span not path) and the immediate feedback from daily tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m curious about the reward system, to see if it really is compelling and there also is some kind of social wrinkle where you can help and get help from other players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the site, here&#39;s how to play:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;How to play&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;definition_summary&#34;&gt;Are you new to Health Month?  Here&#39;s the quick and dirty.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Health Month is all about making small improvements to your health,  one month at a time.  Players (that&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;s you!) can choose 1 or more rules  to try to stick to for a month from the many different dietary, fitness,  relationship, mental health, and financial health behaviors that are  currently in the game.  For first time players, 1-5 rules is a nice way  to start.  Choose rules that you want to work on, and try to make small  improvements to your current behavior rather than going cold-turkey,  whole-hog, or crazy-wombat.  You can always ratchet up the difficulty  next month,  once you get the hang of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are life points?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you commit to your rules, you start each month with 10 shiny  new life points.  The goal is to end the month with at least 1 life  point.  You lose a life point whenever you don&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;t stick to one of your  rules, but don&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;t worry if you lose all of your life points &amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&#34; that&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;s what  friends are for!  Friends and other players of Health Month have your  back when you need to be healed (this is a big part of why Health Month  totally rocks compared to other health plans and services).  This game  is NOT about making you feel guilty.  It&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;s  about helping you discover what works for your current lifestyle (do  more of that) and what doesn&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;t (skip it).  Also, if you accidentally  over-commit yourself and and lose all of your life points (I&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;ve seen  some people go to -100 life points and more!  Maybe there should be an  award for being ambitious?), it just means you can take it a little  easier next month.  Life is long.  Small improvements will make a bigger  impact long term.  And, by the way, you can still play the game if you  are -100 life points&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;brvbar; everything still works as usual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When do I play?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every day, during the month that you&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;ve committed to play, you can  come to the site and play your turn.  Spin the Wild Wheel if you feel  like adding an extra helping of whimsey to your game (don&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;t worry, most  of the outcomes are positive) or you can skip it and go straight to  filling out your daily scorecard without collecting $200.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do I do with fruit?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you follow all of your rules for a day, you get a piece of fruit.   You can use fruit to heal other players who have lost life points.   It&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;s a good thing to do, because they&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;ll remember you when you need to  be healed in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where are my friends?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow friends and team mates on Health Month to see a stream of how  everyone else is doing with their game (think Twitter or Facebook for  improving your life).  You&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;re all in it together, and posting questions,  tips, fears, and challenges that you run into helps remind you that  things like this work better when they&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;re done with friends and family.   Don&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;t be afraid to invite them!  :)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Simplicity, Persuasion and Technology</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been reading/watching a lot of BJ Fogg&#39;s work lately. He studies &lt;a href=&#34;http://captology.stanford.edu/&#34;&gt;the persuasive power of technology for positive behavior change&lt;/a&gt;. You&#39;ll recognize my interest here if you read some of my recent posts on game design mechanics and the potential to integrate technology into real world learning. &lt;a id=&#34;more&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;more-557&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Check out his &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/bjfogg&#34;&gt;Youtube channel&lt;/a&gt; for some shorter videos that explain facets of his work &#34;in 60 seconds&#34;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s Dr. Fogg on simplicity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://vimeo.com/2094487&#34;&gt;BJ Fogg on Simplicity&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&#34;http://vimeo.com/bjfogg&#34;&gt;BJ Fogg&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&#34;http://vimeo.com&#34;&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He makes a really important distinction around the 3:20 mark. We tend to think of simplicity as a feature of our technology, but he disagrees. Instead, he says &#34;simplicity is a perception we have of the experience in accomplishing the task&#34;. This means that you have to consider the person and the context if you want to facilitate behavior change, not just the information you are giving them, or the medium you are using to deliver the information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the coming weeks, I&#39;ll write more about his 3-part behavior change model, summed up as &#34;putting hot triggers in the path of motivated people&#34; and try to explain how I see Motivation, Ability, and Triggers applied to teaching, business, and technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s all fascinating stuff!&lt;/p&gt;
