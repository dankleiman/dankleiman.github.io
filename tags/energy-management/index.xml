      <description>Nobody moves through life with exactly the same amount of energy. Do you know how much you have to draw on? Do you know how to replenish your reserves? In chi gung, the energetic reserves you are born with are called your &#34;pre-birth chi&#34;. What you cultivate as you go through life, using practices like chi gung,&amp;Acirc; is called &#34;post-birth chi&#34;. You use the combination of what you are born with and what you develop to run your body and your mind.</description>
