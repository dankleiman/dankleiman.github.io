&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Nobody moves through life with exactly the same amount of energy. Do you know how much you have to draw on? Do you know how to replenish your reserves? &lt;a id=&#34;more&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;more-1709&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In chi gung, the energetic reserves you are born with are called your &#34;pre-birth chi&#34;. What you cultivate as you go through life, using practices like chi gung,&amp;Acirc;  is called &#34;post-birth chi&#34;. You use the combination of what you are born with and what you develop to run your body and your mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;But the science of energy development (chi gung) is not just about how much juice you can put out in a short sprint. Work and rest are two sides of the same coin and chi gung will actually help you get better at resting as well. We don&#39;t usually pride ourselves on being good at resting, but wouldn&#39;t you like to feel more refreshed when you wake up in the morning? Or get over a cold in 1 day instead of 3? Or be ready to take on your next big creative project after a few weeks off instead of a few months? When you rest better, you can sprint again SOONER as well as FASTER.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;So the next time you look around and see other people sprinting past you in life, don&#39;t strain to catch up to their speed. Instead, go deeper into your own work/rest cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
