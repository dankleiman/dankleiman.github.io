      <description>I find this topic so interesting. When you start playing with the way eyes influence movement, you begin to unlock connections in the body that you had no other way of accessing. I&#39;ve seen some pretty strange stuff, from pain pretty much vanishing, big muscles magically unlocking, or people being able to run, jump, or lift in dramatically different ways....all from a couple of eye exercises. I know it sounds weird, and I was right there with you until I experienced it in my own practice and taught it to other.</description>

      <description>I&#39;m pretty excited about this: Eyes and Visual Training
It&#39;s my new online course and the first in the Foundations of Relaxation Series I wrote about here. As I&#39;ve been developing the course, I keep saying to myself, &#34;I wish everyone who comes to see me for pain relief or to learn tai chi did this first.&#34; In fact, that&#39;s how I developed the whole series. There are a few simple things that don&#39;t take a lot of oversight or feedback from an instructor that everyone can do to move better (meaning more gracefully and in less pain).</description>

      <description>As a tai chi teacher and movement coach, I get to meet a lot of people who want to relax, slow down and have more energy for the things they love to do in life. But there&#39;s a very common misconception that I encounter and I think it leads people to spend too much time chasing the wrong things when it comes to a relaxation practice. Hopefully, this series will begin to clarify what the best way to start a relaxation practice is and how to most efficiently get the results you want.</description>
