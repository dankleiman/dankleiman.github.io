      <description>Background: Recently, TechCrunch featured an article about the playdeck they use at SCVNGR that outlines the mechanics of gameplay. The article cites at TED talk by game designer Jane McGonigal, which I talk about here.
I was a little disappointed with McGonigal&#39;s conclusion, because she basically offered up the solution as specially-themed video games to leverage the power of game mechanics, or &#34;gameplay superpowers&#34;, to do good in the real world and incite behavior change.</description>

      <description>Jane McGonigal gives a fascinating talk about the &#34;superpowers&#34; cultivated by the game-playing masses (more than 500 million with another billion coming up in the next decade!). Obviously we all have the image of the gamer locked in his mother&#39;s basement, endlessly pawing away at an electronic reward system, like a hamster. McGonigal&#39;s takeaway is a little different though.
She emphasizes the motivation, inspiration, and social purpose built into game play.</description>
