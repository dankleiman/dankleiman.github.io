&lt;p&gt;We discussed the different stages of practice and one of my favorite topics: adopting the right mindset so that the progress you make in your body isn&#39;t outpaced by what you think you&#39;re doing in your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think you&#39;ll appreciate the clarity of Paul&#39;s explanations and I want you to know that this topic is a direct reply to feedback I received on &lt;a title=&#34;The Marriage of Heaven and Earth Qigong&#34; href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/2012/02/15/the-marriage-of-heaven-and-earth-qigong/&#34;&gt;Episode 1, about the Marriage of Heaven and Earth&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a id=&#34;more&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;more-3707&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

      <title>Why You Should Not Worry About Breathing in Tai Chi</title>
      <link>http://dankleiman.com/2012/03/19/why-you-should-not-worry-about-breathing-in-tai-chi/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this Inner Form office hours clip, Nate asked me about a specific issue on breathing in the Marriage of Heaven and Earth qigong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your main focus is Tai Chi, then I would recommend that you pretty much ignore breathing as you practice, but you should focus on opening up the body enough to facilitate deep, even, smooth breathing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the following clips, we look at how opening up the body will lead to deeper breathing, what stages you will go through in this process, and finally, I show him a specific technique for keeping the deep internal connections loose as he does the Marriage of Heaven and Earth qigong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;object width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; classid=&#34;clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000&#34; codebase=&#34;http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0&#34;&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowFullScreen&#34; value=&#34;true&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowscriptaccess&#34; value=&#34;always&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;src&#34; value=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/v/eUtBbDZbjTw?version=3&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;rel=0&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowfullscreen&#34; value=&#34;true&#34; /&gt;&lt;embed width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; type=&#34;application/x-shockwave-flash&#34; src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/v/eUtBbDZbjTw?version=3&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;rel=0&#34; allowFullScreen=&#34;true&#34; allowscriptaccess=&#34;always&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; /&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;more&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;more-3637&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stages of Loosening the Body Up to Access Deeper Breathing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When you work on the body from the outside-in, you will naturally go through several stages of opening the body. First, this will feel like a coordination project, but if you follow the rules laid out in the Tai Chi classics, you are actually creating more internal space, that will make breathing easier, deeper, and more nourishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;object id=&#34;viddler_Trainerfly_318&#34; width=&#34;437&#34; height=&#34;288&#34; classid=&#34;clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000&#34; codebase=&#34;http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0&#34;&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowScriptAccess&#34; value=&#34;always&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowNetworking&#34; value=&#34;all&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowFullScreen&#34; value=&#34;true&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;flashVars&#34; value=&#34;f=1&amp;amp;openURL=26029149&amp;amp;autoplay=f&amp;amp;loop=0&amp;amp;nologo=0&amp;amp;hd=0&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;src&#34; value=&#34;//www.viddler.com/player/f2465210/&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowscriptaccess&#34; value=&#34;always&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowfullscreen&#34; value=&#34;true&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allownetworking&#34; value=&#34;all&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;flashvars&#34; value=&#34;f=1&amp;amp;openURL=26029149&amp;amp;autoplay=f&amp;amp;loop=0&amp;amp;nologo=0&amp;amp;hd=0&#34; /&gt;&lt;embed id=&#34;viddler_Trainerfly_318&#34; width=&#34;437&#34; height=&#34;288&#34; type=&#34;application/x-shockwave-flash&#34; src=&#34;//www.viddler.com/player/f2465210/&#34; allowScriptAccess=&#34;always&#34; allowNetworking=&#34;all&#34; allowFullScreen=&#34;true&#34; flashVars=&#34;f=1&amp;amp;openURL=26029149&amp;amp;autoplay=f&amp;amp;loop=0&amp;amp;nologo=0&amp;amp;hd=0&#34; allowscriptaccess=&#34;always&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; allownetworking=&#34;all&#34; flashvars=&#34;f=1&amp;amp;openURL=26029149&amp;amp;autoplay=f&amp;amp;loop=0&amp;amp;nologo=0&amp;amp;hd=0&#34; /&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Arm Lift Problem in Heaven and Earth&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Heaven and Earth is a great place to train the connection between the arms and the body when you&#39;re in any overhead lifting positions. You&#39;ll see these in Tai Chi to some degree, but definitely in Ba Gua, in the Energy Gates 3rd Swing, and in some standing postures designed to open the upper body. You can apply this principle to any of those practices.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Yin and Yang of Learning and Teaching the Internal Arts</title>
      <link>http://dankleiman.com/2012/03/07/the-yin-and-yang-of-learning-and-teaching-the-internal-arts/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 07 Mar 2012 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://dankleiman.com/2012/03/07/the-yin-and-yang-of-learning-and-teaching-the-internal-arts/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a guest post from my friend and fellow instructor, Paul Cavel. I asked Paul to talk a little bit about his experience teaching all over Europe and what he&#39;s learned after nearly 20 years doing it. There are some great insights here about the internal energy arts that you can apply to your own practice, whether you teach or not. Take note when he talks about practice mindset!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;more&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;more-3549&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;alignleft size-medium wp-image-1537&#34; title=&#34;Paul and Energy Arts Instructor Peter Jenkins&#34; src=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/uploads/2011/06/Paul_Cavel_SPC1-225x300.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Paul and Energy Arts Instructor Peter Jenkins&#34; width=&#34;225&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been traveling around Europe teaching internal arts in England, France, Germany and Greece since 1995, as well as training with my teacher almost every year in the United States since 1994. Through these experiences, I&#39;ve had the opportunity to meet people of many different backgrounds and observe how cultural influences can give them unique perspectives on most any subject, including their neigong training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, more than any cultural differences, I see that the real challenges come from the Western mindset being so radically different to the Eastern approach. I know for me, as a Westerner learning ancient Eastern arts, the initial hurdle was to figure out the methodology underlying the great content I was training, so I could see the bigger picture--the proverbial light at the end of the tunnel. There are 16 neigong, each with many, many layers of complexity, and dozens of forms to learn in any one system, so understanding how each can be integrated into the whole within the linear Western model for learning can be a bit tricky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The students who achieve real and sustainable results from their practice are those who approach their training with patience, dedication and consistency. Perhaps most importantly, they have the willingness to work towards balance in all aspects of their being, rooting out weaknesses rather than only playing to their strengths--tenants consistent with an Eastern learning strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;East Meets West&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Some people approach their practice as though they have &#34;been there, done that,&#34; but from an Eastern perspective, that would be completely missing the point. Instead, it&#39;s about the depth and range of your skill set and how you can apply it in every conceivable way--not just in your practice, but in life. The students who catch onto this style will, over time, automatically weave in mechanics that create flowing forms and circulate blood and chi more profoundly. These are the factors that influence health and well-being, and give the most experienced practitioners the ability to achieve seemingly superhuman results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find a tai chi class in almost every major city across the Western world, but few schools teach the deep internal content that underlies and powers up these forms as originally propagated in the East. Many schools have resorted to a linear teaching style to suit the average Westerner, but the Eastern approach has always been a circular progression: that is you learn a technique and practise it for awhile, developing your skill to the extent you can over several weeks to months. When you reach a plateau and your practice seems to stop evolving, you move on to other techniques, integrating everything you&#39;ve learned within your forms (qigong sets, tai chi styles or bagua palm changes). Later, you return to the original technique, once again singling out that thread and further refining it. Although, upon revisiting the technique, your increased awareness--in body, mind and chi--contributes to an upgrade in your overall understanding and execution of the technique. This circular learning process creates a multiplying, self-sustaining positive feedback loop in your practice and the results you can achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Structure-Flow Continuum&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Most students approach their practice from one of two ends of the spectrum: either from the perspective of flow or structure. That is there are those who gravitate towards the integrity of the movement form (i.e. successful execution of component pieces that combine to create a physical form) and others who focus on the flow, or the overall quality of motion within any given form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the point of view of teaching the internal arts, it is helpful to know where a student&#39;s talent lies--either in flow or structure. Initially, using their natural ability, you can focus on that stream of information to help them gain some momentum. Once they gain some skill in that which comes easier for them, then a good teacher will use this momentum to redress the balance by focusing on exercises that will develop the opposite end of the continuum. This approach allows students to see the bigger picture with their talent being the driver of their success. As anyone who trains with an emphasis on internal power development knows, it is the balance between form and flow that is at the crux of all matters relating to how much benefit any one person will get from their practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Life as a Traveling Teacher&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Teaching in different cultures for nearly two decades tuned me into the fact that, as a teacher, I cannot be attached to one style or method of presenting material as each culture, city, class, group or individual will have a slightly unique disposition. Although any given culture might be predisposed to start from a particular perspective, the magic of the internal arts is in the details and how they seamlessly integrate with all others. So there really is no starting line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The circular progression of learning is about building up and breaking down component pieces in endless weaves and patterns, essentially looking at every possible angle to create a well-integrated, balanced form. This kind of assimilation is what allows students to overcome obstacles and achieve their goals, regardless of where they begin. From the perspective of teaching, I&#39;ve not found anything more rewarding than helping students come to this realization and take on a long-term outlook towards their training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

Since 1987, Paul has studied the Energy Arts System in-depth, including qigong, tai chi, bagua zhang, Longevity Breathing therapy, qigong tui na energy healing and meditation. In 1995, with the encouragement of his teacher, he began offering an integrated health, fitness and stress-management solution to exercise and strengthen the body while releasing blockages -- in mind-body-energy -- that help people realize their true human potential.

      <title>Making More Space Inside Your Body</title>
      <link>http://dankleiman.com/2012/03/05/making-more-space-inside-your-body/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 05 Mar 2012 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://dankleiman.com/2012/03/05/making-more-space-inside-your-body/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most counter-intuitive feelings in qigong, Tai Chi, or Ba Gua is the way that making more space inside the body allows you open more outwardly as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these two Inner Form office hours video clips, I show Brendan how making more space in the kwa and shoulder&#39;s nest can help her take a more connected step in her circle walking practice and develop a more fluid single palm change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond Ba Gua practice, you can apply these same principles to working deeper into your Tai Chi form, developing a more connected and integrated structure in San Ti, and even in your more neutral standing posture, as in Energy Gates, you can find more space and settle into the posture, to unify your four points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s how:&lt;a id=&#34;more&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;more-3492&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A special note about meditation:&lt;/strong&gt; When Bruce Frantzis teaches Taoist meditation, one of the main tenets he emphasizes is that there is as much space inside the body as there is outside. Taoist Inner Dissolving works by taking you deeper and deeper into internal space, at ever-more-subtle levels. Ultimately, you develop the ability to extend your awareness out as much as in.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Turn the Legs to Turn the Body</title>
      <link>http://dankleiman.com/2012/02/20/turn-the-legs-to-turn-the-body/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 20 Feb 2012 09:01:07 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://dankleiman.com/2012/02/20/turn-the-legs-to-turn-the-body/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When you see a series of exercises, you can either look at what&#39;s common to all of them, or how they are different. In this video, I go through several variations of turning exercises, where I&#39;m using the connection between the legs and the spine to drive body movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people will look at the arms in each exercise and say, &#34;those are not the same movements&#34; and that&#39;s true, but they would be missing the most important part: &lt;strong&gt;how the legs turn the body&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;more&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;more-3517&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;object width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; classid=&#34;clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000&#34; codebase=&#34;http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0&#34;&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowFullScreen&#34; value=&#34;true&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowscriptaccess&#34; value=&#34;always&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;src&#34; value=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/v/GoqiuidbvGM?version=3&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;rel=0&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowfullscreen&#34; value=&#34;true&#34; /&gt;&lt;embed width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; type=&#34;application/x-shockwave-flash&#34; src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/v/GoqiuidbvGM?version=3&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;rel=0&#34; allowFullScreen=&#34;true&#34; allowscriptaccess=&#34;always&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; /&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Same Motor, Different Attachments&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In order to really see what&#39;s going on in this video, you need to think of a motor that can be fitted with different attachments. In our kitchen, for example, we have a mixer that can blend food together, make dough, whisk, grind meat, or cut pasta. The motor is the same in each case, but for every special application, you attach a different tool to the end of the motor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you watch the video above, imagine that I am doing exactly the same thing. The legs and the waist are the motor and the angle of the turn, the arm movements, and the plane that force is expressed along are all the various attachments.&lt;/p&gt;

[ismember]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Psoas Connection&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The easiest way to start to develop this connection is to understand how the psoas muscles connect the legs to the spine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, these big muscles run from the upper part of your thigh and attach to each side of your spine. They work like a steering mechanism. If you want to rotate the spine to the right, the psoas on the right contracts, pulling your spine that way. To turn left, the right side relaxes and the left side contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see the beginning of this mechanism in the first exercise in the video, the Peg Board drill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned the Peg Board drill from Z Health founder Dr. Eric Cobb. The Peg Board concept is that as one heel pushes down, the other rises up, as if it were pushed from below by a peg. So we imagine standing on a &#34;peg board&#34; to do this exercise. The goal is to find the connection from one leg into the spine and through the pelvis to the other leg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next exercises expands on the Peg Board by adding more turning (0:12). Here, I&#39;m letting the pull through the leg turn the hips. You start the Peg Board looking a little like Elvis, but here you try to smooth it out. Think of the alternative. When you see people turn from the shoulders or even the hips, the body is not as smoothly integrated. What we develop from the Peg Board exercise is having a clear, connected, swiveling base of support. The rest of the body can come along for the ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next (0:16), let the pivot go through the legs completely, to bring the hips around through a 180 degree arc. With this full pivot, you begin to perform something that looks very much like foundation training in many Northern Chinese martial arts. The &#34;bow stance&#34; or &#34;gong bu&#34; is a commonly trained posture and now you can see how it is used to develop whole-body turning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, you can see the evolution of the psoas connection into whole-body turning from this simple 4-part progression. Next, we need to look at the arms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Planes of Force&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Watch the way the arms move&amp;Acirc;  through the various exercises in the video. You will see:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forward force, as in the first punching exercise (0:18)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Horizontal force, as in the bagua cutting exercise (0:36)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vertical force, as in the double teacup exercise (1:26)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Combinations of force vectors like Cloud Hands and Rolling the Ball (2:02)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The cool thing about the leg power you develop this way is that you can express opposite force vectors simultaneously or with a slight change in intention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the bagua coiling exercise (1:10) is usually looked at as a drilling out with the fingers. However, if you pay attention to the elbow on the way back in, you can turn it into a pulling exercise instead. A similar thing happens with the teacup exercise. There is a powerful elbow drop hidden in the falling arm, but most people emphasize the hand or wrist coming in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tai Chi Cloud Hands is the ultimate test of your ability not to fixate on one particular force vector. The way it is organized, you slip through the four basic energies of Peng, Lu, Ji, and An, doing them in pairs. You have to find a way to clearly express each one, and then effortlessly change to the next. In my view, this is why &lt;a title=&#34;Robert Tangora on the Importance of Integration in Tai Chi&#34; href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/2011/11/07/robert-tangora-on-the-importance-of-integration-in-tai-chi/&#34;&gt;Robert Tangora thinks of Cloud Hands as the ultimate practice integrator&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Practice Challenge&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The best way to develop this connection is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to get the hang of the Peg Board drill&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let the action of the legs in the Peg Board drill take you through bigger and bigger turning ranges until you get to 180 degrees&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick one of your favorite exercises that fits this paradigm (standing qigong doesn&#39;t count for this exercise!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scale back the exercise so that it doesn&#39;t feel like you are &#34;doing anything&#34; with the arms (very light &lt;a title=&#34;Three Swings from Opening the Energy Gates Qigong&#34; href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/exercises/three-swings-from-opening-the-energy-gates-qigong/&#34;&gt;First Swing &lt;/a&gt;works well here)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slowly work back up into the full shape of the movement, until you are reasonably confident that you are not using your arms to do the motion, but instead the movement of the legs and waist&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Let me know how it goes!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Twisting Through the Legs</title>
      <link>http://dankleiman.com/2012/02/13/twisting-through-the-legs/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 13 Feb 2012 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://dankleiman.com/2012/02/13/twisting-through-the-legs/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Twisting, especially the legs, is one of those techniques that sounds really cool, but it easy to overdo. Going slow and steady with twisting can help everything loosen up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My advice: at first work on feeling what naturally happens rather than trying to make something happen. Develop sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;more&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;more-3405&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In this &#34;office hours&#34; clip, we look at twisting the legs in Cloud Hands and troubleshoot some of her stuck spots.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;object width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; classid=&#34;clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000&#34; codebase=&#34;http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0&#34;&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowFullScreen&#34; value=&#34;true&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowscriptaccess&#34; value=&#34;always&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;src&#34; value=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/v/yKs6J2_PcPY?version=3&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;rel=0&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowfullscreen&#34; value=&#34;true&#34; /&gt;&lt;embed width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; type=&#34;application/x-shockwave-flash&#34; src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/v/yKs6J2_PcPY?version=3&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;rel=0&#34; allowFullScreen=&#34;true&#34; allowscriptaccess=&#34;always&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; /&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went on to explore the &#34;rings&#34; of the legs, which are horizontal bands of tissue running around the legs. At first, when you work with the rings, you use them as markers for developing better feeling awareness of the soft tissue. Later on, the rings can be adjusted, increasing their internal or external rotation, to fine-tune your leg alignments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, when the legs loosen up and you create strong up and down flows in your movements, you start to access what is referred to as &#34;spiraling&#34; the legs, which really amps up the sense of flow, connection, and power moving through your body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;Tutorial on Twisting through the Legs&#34; href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/inner-form/tutorial-on-twisting-through-the-legs/&#34;&gt;In this Inner Form tutorial, we look at how to develop the twisting of the legs in a safe and systematic way.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Accessing Quiet Awareness with Lee Burkins</title>
      <link>http://dankleiman.com/2011/06/30/accessing-quiet-awareness-with-lee-burkins/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 30 Jun 2011 10:14:44 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://dankleiman.com/2011/06/30/accessing-quiet-awareness-with-lee-burkins/</guid>
      <description>&lt;img class=&#34;alignleft size-medium wp-image-1656&#34; title=&#34;Lee Burkins Ba Gua&#34; src=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/uploads/2011/06/ABG1-200x300.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Lee Burkins Ba Gua&#34; width=&#34;200&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June, between sessions at Brookline Tai Chi and during master classes with Bruce Frantzis, a small group of students got a special treat. Energy Arts Senior Instructor Lee Burkins was in town to train with Bruce, and on one of the nights off, he offered a special evening course on a topic he calls &lt;a href=&#34;http://brooklinetaichi.org/blog/special-evening-mini-topic-lee-burkins&#34;&gt;&#34;Investing in Loss&#34;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I love about studying with someone like Lee is that he&#39;s a  practitioner whose art has soaked so deeply into his bones, that it  practically oozes out of his DNA. Everything he teaches seems so  obviously and natural when he explains it, but you&#39;ve never thought about  it before and never accessed it so effortlessly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the second time he&#39;s taught at Brookline Tai Chi. The first  time, a couple of years ago, he did the same thing with the&amp;Acirc;  Ba Gua  Single Palm Change. Lee took a group of people, most of whom had never  done Ba Gua, and got them gliding around the room, finding the Ba Gua  step, and eventually even spontaneously twisting and turning into the  Single Palm Change. &lt;a id=&#34;more&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;more-1651&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our topic this year seemed more esoteric at first, so I was wondering if he&#39;d be able to do the same thing. What  the heck is &#34;Quiet Awareness&#34; and how do you let that run your physical  body? You could see that with many other teachers, this could have been a  2-hour theoretical lecture. Not with Lee. He snuck up on us with really  clear and simple physical exercises, just letting go of tension and  posture through movements. We let ourselves swirl around and find a  sloshing, fluid, sense of internal space. Once people had settled down  into deeper internal awareness, he showed us how to shape an internal  sense of letting go into a solid physical structure and full, alive, and  responsive physical movement. Obviously this is all a little hard to  explain in writing....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funniest moment though, was after everyone began to really get  what he was driving at, he said, &#34;ok, ok, you&#39;re doing it, so let me  give you something to feed your thinking mind too.&#34; See, the bigger  point he was driving at was that Quiet Awareness is a different mode for  your mind to be in, and you need that to understand your body, your  mind, and your energy. The internal arts are all about accessing this  mode and manifesting it. The problem is, most of us are trained to use a  different mode of awareness, i.e. the thinking mind. As a masterful  teacher, he recognized that, and with the gentle humor he always uses in  teaching, he graciously gave our thinking minds something to chew on  too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Here&#39;s the model he shared:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;Leaves on river by rstrawser, on Flickr&#34; href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/14696088@N04/1544960560/&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignleft&#34; src=&#34;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2395/1544960560_9e4ba9f9f8_m.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Leaves on river&#34; width=&#34;240&#34; height=&#34;180&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Lee took the classic Chinese medicine phrase, &#34;the mind moves the chi  and the chi moves the blood&#34; and formulated it as &#34;the Quiet Awareness  moves the chi and the chi moves the fluids inside the body and therefore  the body as well&#34;. To really get this concept, he explained it like the  current in a river. Think of a leaf floating along in the river. That&#39;s  your body. When the current changes, that&#39;s like the chi shifting. It  shifts direction (inward to outward, up to down), because your Quiet  Awareness shifts first. The interesting part is the lag time between  the change of the current and movement of the leaf. Your Quiet Awareness  turns over, the chi follows, and so does the leaf, but as you are learning  to tune into this process, you can feel the leaf moving along the old  current pattern, even as the current is going a different direction.  Those are the circular transitions you feel in your form.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I don&#39;t know if I quite captured what we did or what Lee was  aiming to teach, but if you ever do get a chance to work with him, take  it. He&#39;s a kind and generous teacher and the naturalness of his art form  that pours out is a real treasure. &lt;a href=&#34;http://coloradointernalarts.com/practitioners.htm&#34;&gt;Lee lives and teaches in Colorado&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In his own words: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I followed up with Lee to see if this recap came close to capturing what he was teaching. Here&#39;s how he describes the process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adjusting the mind&#39;s frequency to smoothly transition from  the&amp;Acirc; vibration&amp;Acirc; of the intellectual aspect to approach and begin to  connect with the vibration/frequency of the intuitive mind. Once you  &#39;experience&#39; this shift in frequency and are able to stay in this mode  (a posture of the mind), &#39;what is hidden will be revealed&#39;, ie, the  connection of the quiet awareness to the chi to the body (nerves,  fluids, and tissues).&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Q&amp;A with Energy Arts Senior Instructor Paul Cavel</title>

He teaches regular weekly classes there, but he&#39;s also been traveling all over the UK and Europe for years teaching workshops, including annual week-long retreats in Crete. I talked to Paul a little bit about his background in Tai Chi, neigong, and Ba Gua and asked him for some practice advice for a group of students who just completed a series at BTC on the Marriage of Heaven and Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me a little bit about how you got started studying these arts. Who were some of your first influential teachers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
After a motorcycle accident in 1986, I started studying Yang style tai chi to heal my injuries. When the teacher left, the class naturally gravitated towards the Water method neigong practices as taught by my main teacher, Bruce Frantzis. I&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;ve been hooked ever since.&lt;a id=&#34;more&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;more-1528&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Over the last 30 years, Bruce has taught in so many different places and formats. When and how did you first start studying with him?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first encounter with Bruce was in a London seminar on the spiraling energy body. Of course, that material really opened my eyes to what qigong could do! When I subsequently lived with Bruce some years later in 1994-1995, my passion for bagua was ignited in his weekly classes. I got in by the skin of my teeth as one of the last students he let into the class&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Since you&#39;ve studied with Bruce, have you had other influential teachers? Have you studied complementary arts that you bring into your teaching?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;ve attended the odd seminar with a reputable Chinese master or two, including a couple of months of early morning training in the park with a master in California. I&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;ve also attended events hosted by the Tai Chi Union of Great Britain where several teachers offer workshops. I&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;ve picked up the odd tidbit here and there from these courses. However, my direction is a product of Bruce&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;s mentoring and the desire to follow the tenants of the genuine Water tradition as passed down by him. Bruce is my one and only teacher.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-1537  alignright&#34; title=&#34;Paul_Cavel_SPC&#34; src=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/uploads/2011/06/Paul_Cavel_SPC1-225x300.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Paul and Energy Arts Instructor Peter Jenkins&#34; width=&#34;225&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me a little bit about your teaching. Do you run regular classes? Workshops? Who are your students?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I teach full-time and offer various teaching formats, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Weekly classes and seminars in Kentish Town, London&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weekend seminars in England and Germany&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weeklong retreats in Greece and Germany&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Corporate training and executive coaching&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Private and small group lessons&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I have students from all walks of life who practise for a wide variety of reasons. Some are looking for a system to maintain health and wellness while others are professionals who want an edge and/or a means for releasing stress. I also see many Energy Arts instructors who want to prepare for certification trainings or upgrade their practice and understanding of the material.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the three most important points that you would like other instructors to know about regarding your practice or your teaching or your business?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; My practice and my teaching are neigong-based. That is I focus on the strands of neigong that develop the body, chi and mind, and then integrate that material into Circle Walking, bagua, tai chi and meditation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;m based in North London where I offer my full programme. The seminar series and retreats I teach in Europe are designed with a particular focus in mind to help students develop that particular aspect of practice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I offer a lot of hands-on personal corrections, partner exercises and component practice sets with a systematic, progressive focus. My aim is to help students solidify their foundation and integrate the deeper aspects of neigong that ultimately intertwine to create the more complex movement forms of bagua and tai chi.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Some of my students have just finished a series on the Marriage of Heaven and Earth, where they learned to open and close the joints of the arms and legs. How should they continue to work on this practice on their own?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have opened up the pulse, the next step is to balance your  system. This is normally done through Circling Hands Qigong, an easy,  repetitive motion that allows the mind to focus on the content rather  that the form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through practice of Circling Hands Qigong, the process is simple:  compare the pulse in the joint on the left side to the corresponding  joint on the right side of your body, and make them the same. This is  done by reducing the joint with the larger range to that of the joint  with the smaller range. Go through all the pairs, e.g. hands, feet,  elbows and knees. Next, compare each pair to all other pairs, e.g. hands  to feet, elbows to knees, shoulders to hips, and equalise any  imbalances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By reducing your range of motion to the joint with the smallest range, you can:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dramatically soften the pulse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Release the nervous system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deepen the pulse in the joints.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Link the pulsing of the joints into one unified lattice, thereby amplifying the positive effects of the pulse.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For more from Paul on the art of pulsing, check out this two-part series,&amp;Acirc;  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.circlewalking.com/1469/pulsing-tai-chi/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.circlewalking.com/1501/pulsing-bagua-zhang/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ba Gua Program Product Launch</title>
      <link>http://dankleiman.com/2010/11/11/ba-gua-program-product-launch/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 11 Nov 2010 06:46:23 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://dankleiman.com/2010/11/11/ba-gua-program-product-launch/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been working with the team at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.energyarts.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Energy Arts&lt;/a&gt; on various projects, but mainly in the capacity as a community coordinator. Currently, my focus is on helping them get a new community discussion forum off the ground, but I also had the chance to participate in the launch of their new Ba Gua Mastery Program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ba Gua Mastery Program is a home-study program with information on circle-walking for meditation and martial arts. They&#39;ve drawn from a live instructor training Bruce taught in 2009, and turned out CDs, DVDs, print manuals...the whole works! It&#39;s been a monumental effort and in the future I&#39;ll be discussing how we&#39;re going to blend live teaching with all these materials at BTC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now though, I want to talk about their launch strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last few weeks, they&#39;ve been building interest by sending out related content without trying to sell the program directly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-290&#34; title=&#34;offer&#34; src=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/uploads/2010/11/offer.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;478&#34; height=&#34;589&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s a screen capture from one of the launch pages on their website.&amp;Acirc;  They&#39;ve added to it as they released new content, so I&#39;ve got back and highlighted what they put out in what order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first piece was a video of Bruce talking about his different Ba Gua teachers in China. On the video page, they included a &#34;pre-launch notification&#34; email list sign-up. In a follow-up email, they reported that over 2000 people opted-in to that list. Not bad, considering that all of the launch copy says they&#39;ll only be selling 250 copies of the program!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second piece was an interview I conducted with Bruce and Richard Taubinger, who is overseeing the launch. We discussed more of the details of the practice itself and why people should be interested in ba gua as an art. I&#39;m not sure about email sign-ups or interest in the interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, in the most direct approach, they gave away some sample material from the product itself, just before the launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not sure how long this page will be up for, but here is the launch page itself: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.energyarts.com/offer/bagua-mastery-program-launch&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;http://www.energyarts.com/offer/bagua-mastery-program-launch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I really like how they gradually, but persistently built interest in the launch, drawing from a list they&#39;ve spent considerable time growing and finally putting just enough urgency around buying (only 250 copies!) that they will hopefully convince the right people to act on it. We&#39;ll see!&lt;/p&gt;
