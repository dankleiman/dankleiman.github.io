      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this video, we&#39;re talking about building up the skill of Outer Dissolving in your standing qigong practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you start out, it pays to follow a recipe - a set of instructions that lead through a certain procedure physically, energetically, and with your mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are times you want to break away from the recipe and times you&#39;ll want to reflect on your experience verbally -- but there are good and bad ways to do both.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;dankleiman.github.io/uploads/2014/02/D0D3E67C-7A7E-4922-89F3-85A0FA4D143B1392219396.012004.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img style=&#34;margin: 5px; border: 0px none;&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;dankleiman.github.io/uploads/2014/02/D0D3E67C-7A7E-4922-89F3-85A0FA4D143B1392219396.012004.jpg&#34; width=&#34;158&#34; height=&#34;281&#34; align=&#34;left&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I&#39;m on day 4 of daily practice by the ocean, but it&#39;s more than that. We&#39;re staying right on the beach, so I get to soak up the energy of the ocean pretty much all day long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I didn&#39;t used to have any sense for what &#34;the energy of the ocean&#34; meant and like pretty much everything else energetic, I&#39;m sure my sense for it will evolve even more, but I want to share my experiences from this week with you anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately we&#39;ve been talking about two ways of practicing standing qigong: &lt;a title=&#34;Form Versus Feel in Standing Qigong&#34; href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/2014/01/09/form-versus-feel-in-standing-qigong/&#34;&gt;by form or by feel&lt;/a&gt;. This week I&#39;ve been using both and both methods have revealed interesting things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;First By Feel&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Holding the same posture for the same amount of time when you stand gives you the opportunity to &#34;just feel.&#34; By having a consistent baseline, the posture and duration, you can compare the feel from one day to the next to reveal new internal space and sensations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you practice by a huge natural power source like the ocean, though, you can also discover &#34;activity&#34; that varies day to day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The energy of the ocean works like a giant amplifier this way. When you settle in and get quiet, you can connect to it and get a big signal boost. In other words, the volume gets turned up on all the internal sensations you typically listen for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What has been so exciting about practice this week is that the thing that gets amplified and really stands out is different each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day it was the lower tantien directing energy down through the legs and stabilizing the lower body. The next day, I found more space and expansiveness through the heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the very first day, a stuck spot I had been working with for a few months began to open up and continued to unwind itself as I sat by the ocean after practice. Thanks, Ocean!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I tell you about practice experiences like this, it&#39;s not that I want you to go out and search for these specific ones. You can&#39;t. You might encounter them, but I didn&#39;t set out with an agenda to experience them ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;You have to open your awareness to see what naturally emerges and your reward is the surprise of discovery.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Doing the Form&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Now, this all might sound like spontaneous practice, but there&#39;s an important role for the form here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember how I framed &#34;just feel&#34; practice? Set the same conditions as much as possible, then be surprised by the contrast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you get the boost from a natural power source like the ocean, you can go back into the form and have extra juice for feeling, sinking, and dissolving, as you work through the body in a systematic way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of you have been sending me questions about sinking versus dissolving lately and I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about the best way to capture the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we go through the process of working on the Gates, you use both techniques in each practice session, dissolving the &#34;&lt;a title=&#34;Energy Gates Dissolving Series&#34; href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/energy-gates-dissolving-series/&#34;&gt;gate of the week&lt;/a&gt;,&#34; then sinking down through the rest of the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, you have the opportunity to contrast the two techniques every time you practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dissolving is lighter, sinking saturates your tissues and gets heavy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dissolving breaks things apart, sinking pulls them down through your body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dissolving is letting go without forcing, so is sinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both cases you have to rest your mind in one place and let the process unfold, but dissolving and sinking happen on different frequencies. Don&#39;t ask me what kind of frequencies. I can tell you that model captures my experience, but I don&#39;t honestly know if that&#39;s an analogy or what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I do know from practicing by the ocean this week, though, is that when you get a Great Amplifier for your form, you build stronger internal connections, go deeper, release more and if you listen just right, you figure out new things about old patterns that you can hopefully bring back with you to your regular practice.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Recipe for Rewarding Practice</title>
      <link>/dankleiman.github.io/2014/01/30/the-recipe-for-rewarding-practice/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 30 Jan 2014 09:50:13 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/dankleiman.github.io/2014/01/30/the-recipe-for-rewarding-practice/</guid>
      <description>&lt;img class=&#34;alignleft size-medium wp-image-4998&#34; alt=&#34;Mixing all the elements of a good qigong practice.&#34; src=&#34;dankleiman.github.io/uploads/2014/01/iStock_000019067988Small-200x300.jpg&#34; width=&#34;200&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#34;Is it better to structure your practice to stay with one energy gate, such as the crown, until you feel some dissolving happening there, or should you just keep moving through the gates week by week moving onto another gate?&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excellent questions like this one keep pouring in. Thank you for sharing your practice experiences with me. I know other folks who read the blog really appreciate it too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love hearing from you guys, especially when your questions are grounded in exploration, practice and thoughtful reflection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check this next one out too. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever articulated the process of sinking chi as clearly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#34;I&#39;m basically aiming to keep my attention on each section of my body as I go down until I feel it has gone sung and has the sense that&#39;s its as relaxed as I&#39;m capable of - as well as the sensation that it has filled with qi (like the sponge analogy). Then I try to feel the leading edge of that fullness until it seeps down to the next section. Does this sound like I&#39;m sinking or dissolving? Or am I somewhere in between perhaps?&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you see the common thread in both of these questions? &lt;strong&gt;Both of these questions are about &#34;practice recipes.&#34;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Practice Recipes for Skill Acquisition&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;ve been reading about learning models a little more lately and I wanted to share the Dreyfus Model of Skill Acquisition with you. If you have the time, these slides give a great overview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe style=&#34;border: 1px solid #CCC; border-width: 1px 1px 0; margin-bottom: 5px; max-width: 100%;&#34; src=&#34;http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/3462945&#34; height=&#34;356&#34; width=&#34;427&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; marginwidth=&#34;0&#34; marginheight=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;a title=&#34;Dreyfus Model Of Skills Acquisition&#34; href=&#34;https://www.slideshare.net/cynthiajoffrion/dreyfus-model-of-skills-acquisition&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Dreyfus Model Of Skills Acquisition&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; from &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slideshare.net/cynthiajoffrion&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;cynthia joffrion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big takeaway is that any time you are building a new skill, it helps to block everything else out and use a set of context-free rules to hone the skill....or in other words, follow a recipe!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Did you notice that experts fall back on rules, recipes, and analysis when things get too complex too?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practice recipes help you separate signal from noise, what&#39;s important from what&#39;s irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look at the five stages in this model, you&#39;ll notice that at a certain point rules are replaced by patterns, then by decisions and intuition. As skills become ingrained, we subconsciously integrate more information than could possibly be explained and reduced to binary rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Practice Recipes in Standing Qigong&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
To apply this model to our standing practice, we need to adopt a novice mindset every time we practice a new way of standing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start out by asking yourself, &#34;if I want to build this skill, what rules should I follow?&#34; Practicing this way will give you &lt;strong&gt;focus and freedom&lt;/strong&gt;: you won&#39;t worry about a million different things and you&#39;ll be able to give your energy over to one or two simple tasks.&lt;br /&gt;
So if we return to the initial question and think about recipes, what do you notice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is it better to structure your practice to stay with one energy gate, such as the crown, until you feel some dissolving happening there, or should you just keep moving through the gates week by week moving onto another gate?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom: 5px;&#34;&gt;This question is equivalent to saying, &#34;I like my bread a little crispier and browner, I think I&#39;m going to leave it in the over for a few more minutes.&#34; The recipe says 25 minutes, but you&#39;re making a choice to leave it in for 30. And that&#39;s fine!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom: 5px;&#34;&gt;The person who asked this question is right on the edge of following the recipe to the letter and exploring, improvising and practicing &#34;to taste.&#34; I&#39;ve worked with a lot of people who don&#39;t play this edge enough. Either they lock themselves rigidly into a form or always go by feel. I don&#39;t think either of those is a good choice.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom: 5px;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instead, you should run through the recipe many times, to really understand the steps and start to see the potential for variation&lt;/strong&gt;, like &#34;I could stay at this gate longer and feel more going on.&#34; Then, when you&#39;ve found a place to go deeper, break away from the recipe and really explore.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom: 5px;&#34;&gt;In this case, any of gate, if it&#39;s a really productive area for you, could be a 2-week, 3-week, or month-long project.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom: 5px;&#34;&gt;In the &lt;a title=&#34;Energy Gates Dissolving Series&#34; href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/energy-gates-dissolving-series/&#34;&gt;Standing Dissolving Series&lt;/a&gt;, I&#39;m giving you weekly recipes to follow and taking you through a whole process, which you could also look at as one 6-month-long recipe to follow.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom: 5px;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My recommendation in this case is to follow the recipe until you feel confident and comfortable without it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style=&#34;margin-bottom: 5px;&#34;&gt;Deeply Ingrained Recipes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Re-read the second question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m basically aiming to keep my attention on each section of my body as I go down until I feel it has gone sung and has the sense that&#39;s its as relaxed as I&#39;m capable of - as well as the sensation that it has filled with qi (like the sponge analogy). Then I try to feel the leading edge of that fullness until it seeps down to the next section. Does this sound like I&#39;m sinking or dissolving? Or am I somewhere in between perhaps?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In addition to being a great description of &lt;a title=&#34;Sinking Your Mind through Your Body&#34; href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/2011/10/03/sinking-your-mind-through-your-body/&#34;&gt;sinking chi&lt;/a&gt;, I want you to notice that it&#39;s also an interesting blend of a clearly structured recipe, but also something that&#39;s done completely by feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you get to this stage with a particular skill, where you&#39;re feeling your way through it in a consistent pattern instead of thinking it through like a list of instructions, you&#39;re ready to layer new skills on top of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In this case, instead of following the leading edge and the seeping sensation, you tune in more to the energy &#34;behind&#34; the area that&#39;s releasing, without leaving that area. Hanging out here, with a listening attitude, sensing what unfolds next, will lead you into dissolving.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dankleiman.wufoo.com/forms/standing-qigong-question/&#34;&gt;Do you have a Standing Qigong practice question? Ask me here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dissolving, Breathing, Structure, and Stillness: Follow-Up Q&amp;A</title>
      <link>/dankleiman.github.io/2014/01/23/dissolving-breathing-structure-and-stillness-follow-up-qa/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2014 08:32:01 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/dankleiman.github.io/2014/01/23/dissolving-breathing-structure-and-stillness-follow-up-qa/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34; id=&#34;docs-internal-guid-38f4178b-bf43-c313-f159-173b20fcce07&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignleft size-medium wp-image-4992&#34; alt=&#34;Stillness of a Mountain Lake&#34; src=&#34;dankleiman.github.io/uploads/2014/01/iStock_000013351742Small-300x170.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;170&#34; /&gt;Thanks to everyone who reached out with questions about the first standing audio practice in the Energy Gates Dissolving series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;I want to share some of the questions with you here. Please let me know if you have any follow-up questions or comments or think there is anything the needs clarification. Hopefully we can approach this series together as an ongoing learning process!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What&#39;s the Difference between Outer Dissolving, Downward Dissolving, and Sinking?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;This first question is a clarification about 3 different types of standing practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;She asks,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;So we are getting acquainted with the the gates in this series in the context of downward dissolving, not outer dissolving.  Is that correct?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;I also have a question about the progression of the standing practice.  Just for the sake of having the big picture, it would be useful to understand when to transition one&#39; practice from each stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;From sinking to downward dissolving&lt;br /&gt;
From downward dissolving to awareness of energy gates&lt;br /&gt;
From awareness to energy gates to outer dissolving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Is this the correct sequence and what are the markers that you are ready to move into the next phase?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;I like the way she lays out the stages, around sinking, awareness, and dissolving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Technically, dissolving a general area and working on a specific gate are both methods of outer dissolving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;As far as deciding which to know or knowing where you are at, these stages of practice are cyclical. You&#39;ll get to a point on any given day or go through periods of practice where one way of standing may call to you more than another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;In this series, I&#39;m going to be emphasizing awareness of the gates with the hope that it turns into dissolving the gates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;In my experience there is a tendency to try to force the dissolving process to happen based on the concept, so I try to encourage people to discover the process more naturally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;If you rest your mind in one area of the body and hold that area in your awareness with the intent to let go (paradox!), then naturally the energy that&#39;s binding it will begin to release. The release goes through phases with &#34;ice&#34;, &#34;water&#34; and &#34;gas&#34; being good landmarks for recognizing and talking about those phases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Does the Weight Fall through the Feet?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Here&#39;s an alignment question that gets a little confusing when you compare the standing we&#39;re doing to other practices where we play with varying the pressure in the feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;The only question I have is regarding letting the weight fall to the center of the feet (rather than the heel).  I understand how this is appropriate for the dissolving part of this standing.  But since, in Dragon and Tiger, Vol.2, pg. 24, Bruce talks about the Shi mian point causing energy to descend down the body, I was wondering if the weight should be more on the heel during the latter part of this standing when we do more of the sinking chi than the dissolving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;This is an interesting case where we look at several layers of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Yes, it&#39;s true that shifting ball to heel helps get energy going up and down. In this case, though, we&#39;re working on a slightly different set of structural alignments, where we want the OVERALL feeling of weight falling through the structure of the pelvis, legs, and feet to be the primary goal. Eventually, these two different techniques are layered on top of each other, even though they seem to be at odds right now - that&#39;s a common qigong experience!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Should I Breath during Standing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;I received several questions about breathing - natural breathing, reverse breathing, breathing connected to energy flows, etc. To this list I would also add any techniques like lengthening, pulsing, twisting - generally anything you would do along pathways, with soft tissues, or joints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;The short answer is: at this point in the process, don&#39;t focus on any of that stuff!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;If we break it down a little more, you will want to go through all of these techniques, and more. But here&#39;s the thing: there&#39;s a tradeoff between a specific focus, like your breath, and the overall container that you create by &#34;holding&#34; the posture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;It&#39;s always felt like two different volume knobs. If you turn up the volume on your breathing, at a certain point, you&#39;ll drown out your sensitivity to other things. On the other hand, if you get just the right volume on the breath, you&#39;ll find a harmony with the mind and your feel for the whole posture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;When you do practice a specific neigong element like breathing or lengthening or pulsing, work it for a few minutes, then stop. And feel. And see if what you&#39;ve set up is primed to go on its own and, with minimal effort, integrate with the whole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Techniques for Closing the Practice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Another student asked about methods for closing the practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;You referred to &#39;gathering&#39; . Can you describe that? Is that just maintaining the form at the end of a practice session and feeling the energy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
At the end of your practice session, especially if you&#39;ve done a &#34;form&#34; like a downward scan, you want to reserve at least a minute or two (sometimes 5 or 10) to just let the inside of your body and your energy go quiet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;There are specific techniques for storing chi in the lower tantien, and we&#39;ll get to those later, but at the very least, you want to create a layer of quiet between the activity of your practice and whatever you go about doing once you finish the practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;The best part of adding this buffer in at the end: &lt;strong&gt;you begin to recognize stillness at other times during the &#34;active&#34; phase of your standing session.&lt;/strong&gt; This is the key to really good dissolving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your Questions and Next Steps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Hopefully you found these questions helpful. Was there anything else you were wondering about during your standing practice?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;If so, &lt;a href=&#34;https://dankleiman.wufoo.com/forms/standing-qigong-question/&#34;&gt;drop me a line here&lt;/a&gt; and I do my best to answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;img class=&#34;alignleft size-medium wp-image-4985&#34; alt=&#34;Standing Qigong Workouts&#34; src=&#34;dankleiman.github.io/uploads/2014/01/StandingNoName-01-300x300.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you read &lt;a title=&#34;Form Versus Feel in Standing Qigong&#34; href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/2014/01/09/form-versus-feel-in-standing-qigong/&#34;&gt;last week&#39;s post on standing qigong&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a title=&#34;Opening the Energy Gates by Bruce Frantzis is The Most Important Qigong Book To Have in Your Library&#34; href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/2011/10/31/opening-the-energy-gates-by-bruce-frantzis-is-the-most-important-qigong-book-to-have-in-your-library/&#34;&gt;the Energy Gates book&lt;/a&gt;, or better yet, you can stand comfortably &#34;just feeling&#34; for 15-20 minutes, you&#39;re probably ready to embark on the downward dissolving process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, I want to help you get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recorded a guided practice mp3 to get you through the first workout in the Energy Gates series: &lt;a href=&#34;https://gumroad.com/l/AEcQ&#34;&gt;Feeling the Gate at the Crown of the Head&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, in this phase, you want each practice session to have a clear structure, so that you release stuck energy in a systematic way. Here is my advice from the last post on &#34;the form&#34; of an Energy Gates standing session:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in week 1, it could look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Settle In  - 5 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feel the Crown of the Head - 5 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan Down through the Body - 3 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Storing Chi - 2 minutes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
But week 11 would look something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Settle In  - 5 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feel from the Crown of the Head down to the Solar Plexus - 5 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feel the Solar Plexus - 8 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan Down through the Rest of the Body - 5 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Storing Chi - 2 minutes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In other words, you should spend a substantial amount of time on whatever gate is the &#34;gate of the week.&#34; However, your practice session should always start with settling, finish with gathering, and have an easy flow down to the &#34;gate of the week&#34; and then from the &#34;gate of the week&#34; down into the ground after the main focus time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ll notice that as you go through the process of the gates, your standing time can go from 15-20 minutes during the first few weeks up to 45-60 minutes towards the end of the process. If you can only manage 15-20 minutes and slowly adding more feels like too much of a strain, I recommend that you stick with the feeling method and not worry about the gates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, if you&#39;re just setting out on this process, you&#39;re probably thinking, &lt;strong&gt;&#34;how am I supposed to be relaxed, feel into my body, and become more sensitive to my chi if I have to remember all these details??&#34;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is exactly why I created &lt;a href=&#34;https://gumroad.com/l/AEcQ&#34;&gt;this follow-along audio practice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check it out and let me know how it goes!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Form Versus Feel in Standing Qigong</title>
      <link>/dankleiman.github.io/2014/01/09/form-versus-feel-in-standing-qigong/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 09 Jan 2014 09:55:48 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/dankleiman.github.io/2014/01/09/form-versus-feel-in-standing-qigong/</guid>
      <description>&lt;img class=&#34;size-full wp-image-2355 alignleft&#34; alt=&#34;Standing Qigong&#34; src=&#34;dankleiman.github.io/uploads/2011/10/basic-standing-posture.jpg&#34; width=&#34;159&#34; height=&#34;337&#34; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you set out to develop your internal energy using standing postures, there are two main ways you can go about it: &lt;strong&gt;by feel or by form&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, there will be a lot of overlap in these two broad approaches, like aligning your body with gravity without collapsing internally and progressively releasing and relaxing as you stand, but when it comes to the role of the mind, form and feel can be very different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Feeling Approach&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You stand &#34;by feel&#34; for a few different reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, a good period of feeling, taking stock, and getting comfortable is useful almost any time you do your standing practice. Because our initial orientation in standing is inward, and we&#39;re likely coming to it from a lot of outward-facing activity, taking 3, 5, or even 10 minutes to just stand and feel creates a nice buffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;ve settled in to your practice, then any &#34;form&#34; work you do for the remainder of the standing session will be much more productive: you&#39;ll be quieter, more relaxed, and more tuned-in to your internal environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In fact, I recommend that you get to a comfortable baseline of just being able to settle, relax, and feel your body in a standing posture for 20 minutes before you move on to the form phase.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason to take the feeling approach is to fully appreciate the effects of your posture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The posture pictured above is a neutral posture, also referred to as Wu Chi. As soon as you raise the arms or change the stance, the effect of the body position will begin to shape what you feel, physically and energetically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, if you pick a different posture, you automatically start doing a different form. You don&#39;t need to do anything special with the mind. Just feeling the new effects of a specific posture, compared to your Wu Chi baseline, can be enough to keep you occupied through much longer (2-hour!) standing sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, by taking the feeling approach, you can build your connection to the ground. As you stand, &lt;a title=&#34;3 Essential Questions to Ask Yourself During Standing Qigong&#34; href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/2012/07/02/3-essential-questions-to-ask-yourself-during-standing-qigong/&#34;&gt;ask yourself these 3 questions&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Over time, you will become more rooted, relaxed, and connected&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Moving into Standing Forms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Once you have a solid baseline of feeling the body, you can begin to work on the form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, most people are familiar with Tai Chi Forms or choreographed sequences in other martial arts, but what do we mean when we use the word &#34;form&#34; in this context?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don&#39;t think of &#34;form&#34; as movements, but instead think of it as a procedure, then it starts to make more sense. And the value of having a procedure, or a repeatable process, is that you can begin to see how you&#39;re changing over time by performing it, both because you can use it as reference point and because doing it actually changes you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In standing, the form is going to be what you do with your awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here I want to warn you:&lt;/strong&gt; just like someone who follows the rote choreography of the Tai Chi form with no regard for softness, relaxation, and connection will be really stiff and awkward, if you follow the mind-forms without regard for the qualities you develop in the feeling approach, you will be stiff and awkward in your standing. You will just be going through a rigid mental checklist and the impact you will have on your energy and physical body will be limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if you can introduce a pattern of progressively sinking the mind through the body, while you maintain relaxation, connection, and root, all of the qualities you began to develop in the feeling approach will be amplified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Your First Form: Downward Flow&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In Opening the Energy Gates of Your Body, Bruce Frantzis teaches a standing qigong sequence that is designed to clear stagnant chi out of your energetic system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic process is a standing &#34;form&#34; where you begin at the crown of the head and move your mind downward through the body each time you practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the first level, an Energy Gates practice session is structured like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Settle In (using the feeling method described above)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Downward Scan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stillness, Settling Again, or Storing Chi&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The more you practice Energy Gates, the more you will refine the Downward Scan piece. &lt;strong&gt;Specifically, you will go through stages of feeling your body to feeling your energy to sinking your energy and finally to dissolving your energy. &lt;/strong&gt;Bruce discusses each of these stages in depth &lt;a title=&#34;Opening the Energy Gates by Bruce Frantzis is The Most Important Qigong Book To Have in Your Library&#34; href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/2011/10/31/opening-the-energy-gates-by-bruce-frantzis-is-the-most-important-qigong-book-to-have-in-your-library/&#34;&gt;in the Energy Gates book&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At each stage of this process, though, the form is the same. You start at the top and work your way down. Every time you go through the body this way, no matter at what layer, you are strengthening the downward current of energy, which has a powerful restorative effect over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often joke that the downward flow of chi in your body plays the same role as the downward flow of water in the plumbing system of your house. Not enough downward flow is a problem there, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Energy Gates Over Six Months&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When you read the book or hear someone explain the Energy Gates process, it&#39;s easy to picture a whole bunch of dots all over the body that light up as you do your scan. In fact, learning to feel the gates themselves is a natural extension of just being able to feel the denser tissues of the body directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to tune the mind to a slightly different frequency, but all the time spent standing and feeling pays off here: you&#39;ve trained your mind to stay in one spot for extended periods without jumping around and without tensing up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you set out to do a complete pass through all the gates, it roughly breaks down into a six-month project. There are 23 main places you&#39;ll want to work with and you could work with one per week (you can definitely spend longer on each gate, but this is just the basic formula). Here is the list from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.energyarts.com/energy-gates-qigong&#34;&gt;the Energy Arts resource page&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bai hui, or the crown of the head.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The third eye, the eyes, the center of the ears and the temple. Also the four jaw points.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where the tongue touches the roof of the mouth and the throat notch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The base of the skull and in between each of the cervical (neck) vertebrae down to the seventh cervical vertebra at the base of the neck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From where the tongue touches the roof of your mouth to the end of the breastbone, on a line about the width of your mouth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The four points of the shoulder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The elbows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The wrists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The hands (all the points).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The joints where the ribs connect to the sternum, the spaces between the ribs, the joints where the ribs connect to the spine, the area between the shoulder blades and the spine. For women only: the gates of the breasts (directly behind the nipples).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The solar plexus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The whole of the belly, starting from the front and dissolving through the internal organs back to the spine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The tantien and the mingmen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All the points along the spine, from the occiput to the tailbone, paying special attention to the occiput, the seventh cervical vertebra, the vertebra in the center of the shoulder blades, the one at the base of the shoulder blades, mingmen and the tailbone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The hip sockets, the pelvic bones, and the kwa (that is, the area inside the front crest of the hip bones).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The anus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The genitals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The perineum.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The knees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ankles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The feet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Below the floor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Above the head.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Now, when you start working through the gates, the structure of your practice session will change from what we laid out earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in week 1, it could look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Settle In  - 5 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feel the Crown of the Head - 5 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan Down through the Body - 3 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Storing Chi - 2 minutes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
But week 11 would look something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Settle In  - 5 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feel from the Crown of the Head down to the Solar Plexus - 5 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feel the Solar Plexus - 8 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan Down through the Rest of the Body - 5 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Storing Chi - 2 minutes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In other words, you should spend a substantial amount of time on whatever gate is the &#34;gate of the week.&#34; However, your practice session should always start with settling, finish with gathering, and have an easy flow down to the &#34;gate of the week&#34; and then from the &#34;gate of the week&#34; down into the ground after the main focus time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ll notice that as you go through the process of the gates, your standing time can go from 15-20 minutes during the first few weeks up to 45-60 minutes towards the end of the process. If you can only manage 15-20 minutes and slowly adding more feels like too much of a strain, I recommend that you stick with the feeling method and not worry about the gates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is it Very Taoist?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Here you might start to wonder about whether some of these guidelines for the form seem too rigid. How do you reconcile these recommendations with what you feel when you stand free-form?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And by the way, I&#39;m not saying that &#34;feeling&#34; is kindergarten and &#34;form&#34; is more advanced. In fact, you should cycle between periods of each as you practice over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guidelines and form serve a purpose. You need to work through the structure to develop certain things. Eventually, will you have a more intuitive feel for what you need and how much? Of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the mean time, though, Flannery O&#39;Connor captured the issue well, when she argued for a classical education: &#34;And if the student finds that this is not to his taste? Well, that is regrettable. Most regrettable. His taste should not be consulted; it is being formed.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However counter-intuitive it seems at first, the best feeling, the most relaxation, and the greatest internal stillness that I&#39;ve ever uncovered has come from the practice periods when I&#39;ve given over to a form to follow. Later on, I can bask in that energy and &#34;just feel&#34; and enjoy it, but to get there, it was a lot of little small, formal steps along the practice road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wherever you find yourself on the standing path now, I hope this helps orient you a little more. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tai Chi Practice Advice from Master Feng Zhiqiang</title>
      <link>/dankleiman.github.io/2013/09/26/tai-chi-practice-advice-from-master-feng-zhiqiang/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2013 14:44:28 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/dankleiman.github.io/2013/09/26/tai-chi-practice-advice-from-master-feng-zhiqiang/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Feng Zhiqiang was a famous Tai Chi Master from Beijing who was a major influence on my teacher &lt;a title=&#34;Bruce Frantzis&#34; href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/bruce-frantzis/&#34;&gt;Bruce Frantzis&lt;/a&gt;. Master Feng did some teaching in the West as well and we are fortunate to have access to a transcript of a 2001 workshop he taught in the Bay Area (thanks to the folks at SilkReeler.com for making &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.silkreeler.com/drupal/?q=node/24&#34;&gt;this transcript&lt;/a&gt; available and thanks to Igor for sending it my way!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here he is in 1986 performing a Chen Style Form:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/gVtO7pod5hM?rel=0&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; width=&#34;420&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 2001 workshop, Master Feng gives some great advice about different dimensions of practicing Tai Chi and qigong. I think you&#39;ll find the advice relevant to your own practice. Throughout the interview Master Feng is humble about his incredible skill and what&#39;s more, you can really tell that he was still actively practicing and learning, not resting on his credentials as the Master.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even here, when he&#39;s describing a training process, we learn that he&#39;s working on it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Master Feng says, &#34;... Gentle practice is more effective than forceful practice. Lengthening is better than contracting. It&#39;s not just a simple matter of health, it&#39;s also a very good stretching exercise.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To which his student replies, &#34;Some of us may have noticed Grandmaster Feng has much longer arms than the rest of us. That&#39;s a result of practicing lengthening. Thirty years ago when we took a picture together, I noticed in the photograph that Master Feng&#39;s arm is about one finger longer than mine.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The master always keeps working!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve pulled a series of quotes and questions and answers from the transcript that I found particularly helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;On Structure and Body Alignment for Tai Chi&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even when you are standing upright, your weight should only be on one leg. When you&#39;re standing you should be relaxed and have your weight shifting from one leg to the other, never stationary and fifty-fifty. But not too obvious, that looks too funny. Don&#39;t let it be visible to an observer, but you should shift your weight from one leg to the other. Same thing with the foot. When you are standing you should never tighten your foot, and you should also flex it gently. Never stay in one position. Practicing in a relaxed manner is better than tensing up.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;On Whole-Body Coordination and Power&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curved line is better than straight line. Even when your limbs are lengthened, they should also be curved. The body is the same. It should never be too straight. There should always be a curve somewhere. The Taiji body has five bows [Verbal clarification from translator: as in &#34;bow&#34; and arrow]. One arm, the other arm &amp;mdash; two bows. One leg, the other leg, and your spine - your body. So, five bows. There is a Taiji saying that &#34;once the body has cultivated five bows, (and can express the spring-like power) there is no equal opponent under Heaven.&#34; [Demonstration] This is one bow as well. Curving the chest is also a bow. Only by practicing in a slow and lengthening manner, you can then cultivate the spring-like energy. Something with springiness is very strong. If you drop it, it will never break. But if you have something that is hard and brittle, when you drop it it will shatter. That&#39;s what the old martial arts masters would say. If your body has five bows and you have this spring-like power, you will have no equal opponent under Heaven. Practicing martial art, you should know the theory. Only by knowing the theory can you grasp the martial aspect of Taiji.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;On Uncontrollable Shaking during Standing Qigong&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In the Q&amp;amp;A section of the transcript, Master Feng gives some direct, and indirect, practice advice. The first question is about standing qigong. He is asked, &#34;Basically, how should we stand? Any tips on standing? Some students have experienced interesting phenomena like uncontrollable shaking, whether that&#39;s good or bad, and whether we should do anything about it.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Master Feng starts off with what appears to be a very theoretical answer, but I found it to be a pretty accurate description of the &#34;interesting phenomena.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone, greetings. This is a good question. Standing posture is Wuji, [Translator note: as in &#34;ultimate nothing&#34;]. Standing posture is posture of Wuji. Wuji is the state before Heaven and Earth was formed, when everything was in the primordial soup, when yin and yang were not differentiated. Wuji is silence, not moving, is quiet, whereas Taiji, the name of our practice, is opposite. Even though it looks as if standing posture/standing meditation there&#39;s no movement, however inside, just like in the primordial soup, there&#39;s always something, there&#39;s always something moving. When the internal subtle movement suddenly reaches critical level, then there&#39;s a Big Bang. That&#39;s when the light stuff floats up and the heavy stuff sinks down. And those that floats up form the heaven, and things that condenses become the Earth. The Big Bang essentially causes Taiji to happen. Taiji is yin and yang, the interplay between yin and yang. Between the interplay of yin and yang, everything else in this world is born. Without Taiji there&#39;s nothing, there&#39;s not even us. Everything, all life forms. Plants, animals. Human being are at the top of the animal kingdom, we are spiritual beings. The relationship between Heaven, Human, and Earth is the three pillars of the universe. Basically, from Wuji, even though there&#39;s no apparent movement, there&#39;s always something happening internally. When the time is right, the universe is formed, and Taiji is born. Same thing when we&#39;re doing standing meditation. There&#39;s no apparent movement, but there&#39;s always a little subtle shift. And after you&#39;ve been doing it for a while you could generate so much energy in your body that you&#39;d just have to move, that&#39;s the time for you to start doing your form. Within Wuji, even though the external is without motion, inside there is the beating of the heart, the circulation of blood, the flowing of chi. So within the motionless external something is contained inside that is moving.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
He continues with a very detailed cosmological description of the process of moving from Wu Ji to Tai Chi and beyond, which I won&#39;t add here. But then he returns to a very practical tip. I bolded the parts I thought were especially important:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s go back to the standing meditation and involuntary movement. Not everyone will experience it. Some people will experience different feelings, different sensations, when your qigong practice is up to a certain level. Movement is one of them. It&#39;s normal to move. &lt;strong&gt;However, do not seek movement for its own sake.&lt;/strong&gt; The movement is a side effect. What we want to do is keep our attention, our intention, within our DanTien, and let the movement be. If the movement continues without bothering you, that&#39;s fine. But if it gets bigger and bigger, then you should use your will power, your mind, to tell it &#34;look, just stop it; don&#39;t move.&#34; Usually that will take away or control the movement. However if the movement is so big that it&#39;s beyond your control, then it&#39;s time to stop. You should do the DanTien turning exercise, gathering all the Qi that is wandering about back into your DanTien, and stop doing QiGong. &lt;strong&gt;Some movements are actually good phenomena. However we should not seek the phenomena. We should just focus on practicing QiGong.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;On Fitting Practice into Our Busy Lives&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, I love how he addressed the question about learning all these forms and exercises, but not having enough time each day to practice them. If you follow his rules for practicing on limited time, you&#39;ll definitely turn even a few minutes into high-quality practice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we have limited time, what should we do on a daily basis? You should at least cover two things: One is qigong, as many movements as you can do, and then the 24-form. However if you don&#39;t even have time to cover those two things, what you can do is, put the 24 aside and concentrate on a subset of qigong exercises. And those examples he was showing us, &#34;Heaven open, Earth close,&#34; or &#34;Earth open, Heaven close,&#34; that&#39;s one. Or &#34;double hand open-close,&#34; that&#39;s another one. So if you do those, that&#39;s ok. But you need to do more than nine repetitions if you just want to do one thing. And he&#39;s suggesting a few hundred repetitions. At least a hundred times or two hundred times. He&#39;s saying that because qigong is the foundation, is the core of our practice, if you don&#39;t have time for anything else, then do the core. However, it&#39;s best that you try to put aside at least an hour a day to do qigong as well as the 24.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
So there you have it, practice advice from a Master.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, last spring, Master Feng passed away. You can read more about him &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.taichimaster.com/tai-chi/feng-zhi-qiang-death/&#34;&gt;in this tribute from Bruce Frantzis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Mon, 09 Sep 2013 08:19:44 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/dankleiman.github.io/2013/09/09/follow-up-questions-on-standing-qigong/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was thrilled to receive such a positive response to &lt;a title=&#34;From Inevitable to Impossible in Standing Qigong&amp;hellip;.and Back Again?&#34; href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/2013/09/03/from-inevitable-to-impossible-in-standing-qigong-and-back-again/&#34;&gt;my last post on Standing Qigong&lt;/a&gt;. And it wasn&#39;t just support, even though I confessed that now I have to climb back up the mountain on the way to 2-hour sessions again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You guys asked really great questions about standing qigong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of answering them in &lt;a href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/2013/09/03/from-inevitable-to-impossible-in-standing-qigong-and-back-again/#comments&#34;&gt;the comments of the last post&lt;/a&gt;, I decided to turn the questions into a post of their own. So here we go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Form vs. Content in Standing Qigong&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
There were lots of questions about what I see as a &#34;form vs. content&#34; distinction in standing practice. In Tai Chi, it&#39;s much easier to separate choreography from internal content (although, there are certainly forms that lead you to internal content if you approach them correctly). In standing it&#39;s not so clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You end up doing &lt;a href=&#34;http://cookdingskitchen.blogspot.ie/2013/07/what-really-happens-when-we-stand.html&#34;&gt;what Dara pointed us to&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;TWO APPROACHES TO RELAXATION&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first approach involves using the mind to square everything away, so to speak. That is, going through the body step-by-step from Baihui point and above the head, down through the bottoms of the feet, correcting alignments, opening the various points and locations by relaxing and adjusting as necessary&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second approach is deceptively simple. &#34;Don&#39;t think, feel!&amp;hellip;&#34;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You can really get caught up in the &#34;form&#34; of scanning from the crown of the head (Baihui point) down to the feet. But as soon as you see it as a form, like Grasp Sparrow&#39;s Tail, you are free to really feel &lt;strong&gt;how&lt;/strong&gt; your are doing it, not just robotically repeat it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Igor&#39;s question, about adding pulsing into your standing practice, is exactly the opposite. Essentially he asks, &#34;what&#39;s the minimal amount of form I need to use to be able to train internal content?&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His exact question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Would you advocate the &amp;lsquo;Feel don&#39;t do&amp;rsquo; approach at all times or &amp;lsquo;Do Form&amp;rsquo; has its own phase whenever we try to introduce something new? Or maybe once the alignments have set up the &#34;feel don&#39;t do&amp;rsquo; would be preferable regardless?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I&#39;m wondering because just last week I started to explore how I could introduce pulsing in my standing practice; and at least in the beginning phase this requires accurate going through the steps/forms.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;And in general, Isn&#39;t it something like trying to distinct between form and formless (spontaneous) qigong?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
He&#39;s right about the need to &#34;work&#34; each neigong component that you want to manifest in your practice. I don&#39;t think you can amorphously feel your way into them (and I don&#39;t trust anyone who says you can because when you look at THEIR practice journey, that&#39;s not how they go anywhere.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some techniques are easier to do in certain modes of practice than others. For example, dissolving or sinking chi is easiest to learn for most people in standing. Opening and closing, or pulsing, &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be easier to learn in motion, but Igor&#39;s going to try it in standing. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend that you stick with working the technique into your system, but also, give a healthy amount of time to simply feeling and seeing if you&#39;ve activated the opening and closing. It&#39;s kind of like turning a flywheel, you have to crank it, but there&#39;s also a moment where it spins on its own. You need to be listening for those moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as spontaneous qigong, I don&#39;t know. From what I&#39;ve seen, that&#39;s a different kind of not-doing. With opening and closing, for example, when you &#34;just feel,&#34; you are feeling INSIDE the container of the posture. The spontaneous qigong I&#39;ve seen seems to lack even that kind of shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Once you recognize that there is a &#34;form&#34; to your standing qigong, though, you also realize that you don&#39;t always have to &#34;do the form.&#34;&lt;/strong&gt; You should. And there are benefits. But it&#39;s also perfectly good to just feel and enjoy the shape you&#39;ve created. There&#39;s also way more going on in the posture than you will ever find if you always lead with mental instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine a teeny-tiny rider trying to direct a huge elephant....the rider is your Instructing-Brain sitting on top of your energy field, often thinking that it&#39;s steering the elephant down the path. But how much more is really going on with the elephant! You are the elephant too....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe we&#39;re stretching the metaphor a little bit here, but understand that there is way more to the practice than reciting a checklist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin echoed some of these same concerns about getting caught in the trap of feeling like you must do a form or have a specific experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;When you talk about obsessing over visualizing the energy gates, it sounds like how I&#39;ve been feeling about trying to feel blockages. I&#39;ve been working on the sinking phase for more than 2 years and am only now experiencing a more sung like feeling during sinking. More recently, with my attempts at dissolving I&#39;m finding &amp;hellip;..well&amp;hellip;.nothing! It seems like 98% of the time I can&#39;t seem to feel what Bruce describes as the conditions of a blockage. I typically stand for about 20-25 min before moving on to the rest of the energy gates set (although I haven&#39;t been timing my standing recently). Do you think it might be helpful to begin increasing my standing via the &#34;minute a day&#34; routine? Do you think this could increase my chances of feeling blockages? &amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;..and one more. What are the chances that there are simply no blockages to dissolve on a given day? Is this a possibility? Your shared insight and perspective is valuable and always appreciated.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
How discreet are the sections you are trying to sink? What are you putting your mind around when you try to dissolve?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you tried sinking the chi of your hand? Or dissolving your hand? I find focusing on just the hand gives you a clear sense of the technique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know these practices can be done for healing and health, but I kind of wish they weren&#39;t always presented in a way that makes you feel like you are scanning your body to find all your flaws. &#34;I know there&#39;s something wrong with me, I just have to find it and then work on a practice where I release all attachment to it.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or maybe, we can zoom out to a macro level and learn to feel whole and integrated first so that the blockages will resolve as the entire energetic matrix is upgraded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will say that I find it easier to get a sense of wholeness and integration using arm postures than with the arms-by-the-sides wu chi. That one, while being neutral energetically, is also neutral energetically. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I mean is that it&#39;s great for training the form of the &#34;Downward Flow&#34; but it&#39;s also easy to shut down your insides as you hold it. Maintaining the energetic flow of the arms and spine in that posture requires some light energetic sensitivity. You have to feel the connection of the chi at the fingertips and crown of the head and be tuned in to how they can easily short out. At least with the arms in the air, the physical challenge is more obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the posture, I believe standing should make you feel more whole, not more broken or fragmented, which is what I thought about when Woodrow asked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I&#39;m also especially interested in how it affects your meditation practices.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Strictly from a personal point of view, standing for me is integration. Early on, when I first tried to learn sitting meditation, it was disconnection, disassociation, and distraction. Then I learned to stand and everything I wanted to get out of meditation came together for me, internal exploration, integration, and often, resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, I&#39;ve experimented with different kinds of standing, like San Ti, Wu Chi, and now some more structured postures. Each one has spilled over into my life, giving me nuanced and distinct orientations to the world, but at the end of the day, it&#39;s always standing that brings me the sense of wholeness that I imagine other people get from their meditation practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Standing Process and Building Up Time&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Another set of questions focused on how the 2-hour process was done, both in terms of the posture I used and what it was like to add a minute each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew captured the essence of why I abandoned a set agenda and checklist approach in the first place:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Thank you for documenting your journey. It is interesting how the time factor can change the body so much. I have begun to drop so many of the doing parts of standing so some benefits might carry over into a more lasting time-frame. Trying to get the my body to open has been a struggle and I have been tirelessly weaving adjunct practices to assist this process. I think that it&#39;s important to listen to my natural rhythms and plan accordingly. 10 minutes of santi in the morning for instance helps the process without putting a damper on the getting things done mentality I need for work.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Finding the right practice and understanding how it fits with the rest of your daily needs is so important!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Jeff and Erwan who asked about the specific posture:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I find your report extremely interesting. are you doing standing that&#39;s equally weighted on both feet, or are you standing on only one foot (and switching sides from time to time) ?&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Thanks for the posts about your standing practice; they are very encouraging. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A question: Was your two-hour goal accomplished exclusively with Wuji standing, or did you mix the postures up?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;alignleft size-medium wp-image-4518&#34; alt=&#34;Standing Qigong &#34; src=&#34;dankleiman.github.io/uploads/2013/03/20130326-094857-225x300.jpg&#34; width=&#34;225&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;For the two-hour process, I just used one posture, pictured here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weight was 50/50 and the arm posture was (supposed to be!) symmetrical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future, I hope to go to single leg stances, BUT NOT because I want to make the legs stronger by only standing one on. For sure, longer standing built up my leg strength, but there&#39;s something much more profound that can happen too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One time, when I had about 40 minutes left, I felt like I couldn&#39;t hold my arms up anymore. I decided to let them get as soft as possible, over 5 or 10 minutes. Essentially by softening them, they began to withdraw into my body, not so much physically, but in terms of outward effort and exertion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is where a beautiful lesson was revealed to me. Instead of just going limp like wet noodles, all of the energy I was drawing out of the arms went inside. I began to energize the torso, and eventually, the central channel. The more I withdrew, the more I fed my central channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, there was a saturated kind of feeling, and by the end of that 40 minutes, the arms began to naturally grow back out to their full shape, bolstered by the integrity of the central channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m repeating this story here because I believe that the same yin/yang contrast I stumbled onto between the arms and the central channel is much more likely to happen in the body if you are in an asymmetrical stance. We&#39;ve worked on this in Push Hands, repeatedly proving the superiority of single weighted stances for diffusing incoming force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is why I&#39;m looking forward to single leg practice: to feed the yin and yang potential in the legs&amp;hellip;and who knows where else!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as the structure of my practice, Dara asked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;When you did the long standing what was the balance like with moving work: - did you also practise form (and/or nei gung) and for how long? I am not looking for a time table or formula but I am interested in your experience and practice.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m lucky to be able to teach 10-12 hours a week, including Tai Chi, qigong (mostly Marriage of Heaven and Earth during this phase), and practice Push Hands on a regular basis, so I had a lot of moving built into my training week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically, the standing sessions were done separately from teaching and other moving, and I didn&#39;t really follow standing with moving immediately after (like a typical energy gates set, for example). Instead, especially when I hit the 1.5-hour range, it was great to take a walk or just move back into my day and feel the after-effects of the standing permeate normal activities. When I did Tai Chi later in the day, there was always strong carry-over too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when I could practice outside, I had some great experiences, like Linda describes here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I&#39;m a beginner and had an experience I wanted to share from standing Qigong on a windy July day on the beach facing the ocean. It was a windy day. As I stood and sank into the sand I felt tightness in my shoulder. It was maybe 10 minutes into standing. I thought, &#34;maybe my feet has something to do with the tightness&#34;. I also noticed more weight was forward. As I noticed that, my weight shifted and the tightness dissolved. It was so cool! I felt like I could have stood for so much longer. I also wanted to bring a bucket of sand back home and do sandy Qigong. I have since stood barefoot in my backyard and felt the energy from the ground &#34;wake&#34; me up! &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The sense of rootedness and openness of the energy field are so different outdoors. When you go outside to practice, you have to adopt a different attitude. Soak in the world. Again, don&#39;t go to your mental checklist, you&#39;ll miss the best stuff!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opening the root wasn&#39;t restricted to outdoor practice, though. One day, even though I was on a hardwood floor, my root really opened up. And the sensation wasn&#39;t what I expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess the idea I had always had is that I would be able to feel down to the center of the earth or something like that. But as you described, when the feet, and then the space below the feet opened up, I felt every bit of tension drain out of me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other thing that surprised me was that the ground around my feet, maybe in a 2-3 foot radius, softened, and I felt like I was standing in a sink hole. It felt like the floor had caved in and I was in the center of a big dip.&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I captured this experience, and other ones that felt significant, in a daily practice log. Not only do I get to go back and look at these special stands, but the act of recording my practice actually seemed to validate certain components that were then easier to identify when they happened again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote about some of those in the first article, like the cycles of structure I began to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should try the note-taking process too. It only takes 2-3 minutes once you finish and you don&#39;t need a minute-by-minute transcript, just one or two highlights. Once you begin recording, I bet you&#39;ll see bigger patterns in your practice too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going forward, I would recommend this basic practice structure to anyone who wants to discover the fruits of standing qigong:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First learn to &lt;a href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/exercises/guide-to-standing-qigong/&#34;&gt;settle in and feel your body&lt;/a&gt; in a basic posture, until 20 minutes is comfortable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then, follow the &lt;a title=&#34;Opening the Energy Gates by Bruce Frantzis is The Most Important Qigong Book To Have in Your Library&#34; href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/2011/10/31/opening-the-energy-gates-by-bruce-frantzis-is-the-most-important-qigong-book-to-have-in-your-library/&#34;&gt;Energy Gates&lt;/a&gt; practice sequence, doing the Downward Flow form, for 20-45 minutes (by the time you go through all the Gates, 40-45 minutes should be pretty comfortable). This cycle should take a minimum of 6 months to complete, adding a new gate each week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beyond 45 minutes, I worry that going gate-by-gate will make you miss some of the bigger patterns and connections. You certainly can do longer scans, but I recommend free-form standing to explore and see what you notice. This assumes that your Energy Gates Form is strong.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Thank you again for all the great feedback and interesting follow-up questions. Please keep us posted, here in the comments or via email, about all you explore in standing qigong!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Standing Qigong Breathing Exercises -- Mp3</title>
      <link>/dankleiman.github.io/2013/06/27/standing-qigong-breathing-exercises-mp3/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 27 Jun 2013 08:38:09 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/dankleiman.github.io/2013/06/27/standing-qigong-breathing-exercises-mp3/</guid>
      <description>&lt;img class=&#34;alignleft size-medium wp-image-4412&#34; alt=&#34;Better Breathing&#34; src=&#34;dankleiman.github.io/uploads/2012/11/032-300x225.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;225&#34; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest question people ask me about standing qigong, especially when they hear about &lt;a title=&#34;Are You Making Progress in Your Practice?&#34; href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/2013/03/26/are-you-making-progress-in-your-practice/&#34;&gt;the 2-hour project&lt;/a&gt;, is &#34;what do you do, just stand there?&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is actually a really delicate balance between &#34;doing&#34; and &#34;feeling&#34; when you stand. You learn lots of different techniques, like breathing, sinking, dissolving, and pulsing, but how you apply them internally when you are holding a static posture is a tricky topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you rev your engine too much -- activating &lt;a title=&#34;My Favorite Breathing Hack&#34; href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/2012/01/30/my-favorite-breathing-hack/&#34;&gt;strong diaphragmatic breathing&lt;/a&gt; the entire time, for example -- then you miss the potential stillness in the posture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if you zone out, and don&#39;t connect to internal sensations, you&#39;ll miss the potential for integration and you won&#39;t build any chi or walk away with the sense of organization that your standing qigong can provide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do you strike the balance between &#34;do&#34; and &#34;feel&#34; in your standing qigong practice? I&#39;ve put together two breathing exercise mp3 for you to listen to while you practice standing qigong to help you find that balance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/downloads/[Standing]%20Breathing%20to%20Activate%20the%20Back.mp3&#34;&gt;Standing Qigong -- Breathing to Activate the Back&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/downloads/[Standing]%20Breathing%20to%20Activate%20the%20Feet.mp3&#34;&gt;Standing Qigong -- Breathing to Activate the Feet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
These are short, easy practice sessions that focus in on one skill each: you will learn how to use the breath as a guide for your awareness, activating sensation, without overriding the potential for stillness. As you practice, you will be able to apply this same skill to longer and longer standing qigong practice sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One more thing:&lt;/strong&gt; if you enjoy these workouts and find them useful, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;amp;hosted_button_id=QQC5GSTJLQRUW&#34;&gt;considering making a small contribution here&lt;/a&gt;. Think of it as a drop-in class fee. If I know that a lot of people are finding these helpful as practice aides, I will create more of them in the future. Thanks for your feedback and support!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;img class=&#34;alignleft size-medium wp-image-4584&#34; alt=&#34;Tai Chi on the Beach Fan&#34; src=&#34;dankleiman.github.io/uploads/2013/05/Tai-Chi-on-the-Beach-Fan-300x225.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;225&#34; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, we discussed &lt;a title=&#34;Are You Making Progress in Your Practice?&#34; href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/2013/03/26/are-you-making-progress-in-your-practice/&#34;&gt;the sense of progress&lt;/a&gt; you can sometimes struggle with in your practice. At the time, I mentioned that I&#39;ve been working up to a two-hour standing session, which is a very structured practice goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I wanted to report back about what I&#39;ve been experiencing in standing qigong and show you how to shift your sense of the time that passes when you stand. The structure of adding one minute to the length of the stand each day is seems like it should make for a very linear sense of time when you practice. So far, though, that&#39;s not what&#39;s happening at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Linear Time and Work&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When you set your sights on a single two-hour qigong stand, it might sound blissful and energizing or it might sound grueling, especially when you think about inching closer to the goal by adding only one minute a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when the qigong practice is not going well, it is grueling. When the posture is &#34;off,&#34; you experience:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;isolated muscle pulls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;joint discomfort&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tension, pain, and contraction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;energetic blockages&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Your reaction is often to fight these sensations directly, trying to stretch a contracted muscles or shift away from a compressed joint. When you&#39;re fighting a thousand little battles all over your body, time ticks by one second at a time, becoming slow, linear, painful work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cycles of Flow&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When your qigong posture is &#34;on,&#34; it&#39;s completely different. Everything feels continuous and flowing, but at the same time still without becoming stagnant. For example, you might experience your back expanding outward for several minutes or your front releasing inward or your legs sinking downward. You haven&#39;t moved, but the expansive/releasing/sinking quality goes on and on and on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is where time shifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same way that you feel movement and flow without actually moving, time passes without a sense of the minutes ticking by. In this &#34;on state,&#34; the posture feels easy and comfortable. Time doesn&#39;t feel as pressing because you don&#39;t feel like you&#39;re working on the posture. You lose a sense of sustained work, endurance, and duration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this state doesn&#39;t last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can sustain it for a while, but it falls apart. I used to find that very frustrating, until I discovered that it wasn&#39;t all or nothing for keeping the &#34;on state.&#34; The posture comes together and falls apart in cycles. In longer standing qigong sessions you will go through several cycles of flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is how you can find these cycles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find your &#34;natural stand&#34; time: get a clock, close your eyes and just stand for as long as it feels easy and comfortable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat step 1 three times, seeing if the time for your natural stand is consistent (or repeat into you establish and natural baseline).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The next time you practice, add 5 minutes to your natural stand time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notice what happens to your body, mind, and energy when you go into the extra time, past your natural stand time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep adding time into you find your second natural phase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over time, work up to standing for 2 or 3 natural cycles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When your standing posture comes together, the body will be relaxed and integrated, your energy will be flowing, the mind will be expanded and enveloping, and your mood will be calm. As you shift into an &#34;off&#34; phase, you may notice that your body gets stiff and isolated, your energy feels stuck, your mind starts to contract, and you feel impatient. The more you can tune into these sensations at all levels, the more you will be able to recognize the natural cycles of flow in your practice and the &#34;time&#34; you stand for will shift to more circular and integrated.&lt;/p&gt;
