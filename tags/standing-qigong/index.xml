      <description>In this video, we&#39;re talking about building up the skill of Outer Dissolving in your standing qigong practice.
When you start out, it pays to follow a recipe - a set of instructions that lead through a certain procedure physically, energetically, and with your mind. However, there are times you want to break away from the recipe and times you&#39;ll want to reflect on your experience verbally -- but there are good and bad ways to do both.</description>

      <description>I&#39;m on day 4 of daily practice by the ocean, but it&#39;s more than that. We&#39;re staying right on the beach, so I get to soak up the energy of the ocean pretty much all day long.
Now, I didn&#39;t used to have any sense for what &#34;the energy of the ocean&#34; meant and like pretty much everything else energetic, I&#39;m sure my sense for it will evolve even more, but I want to share my experiences from this week with you anyway.</description>

      <title>The Recipe for Rewarding Practice</title>

      <description>&#34;Is it better to structure your practice to stay with one energy gate, such as the crown, until you feel some dissolving happening there, or should you just keep moving through the gates week by week moving onto another gate?&#34;
Excellent questions like this one keep pouring in. Thank you for sharing your practice experiences with me. I know other folks who read the blog really appreciate it too.
I love hearing from you guys, especially when your questions are grounded in exploration, practice and thoughtful reflection.</description>

      <description>Thanks to everyone who reached out with questions about the first standing audio practice in the Energy Gates Dissolving series.
I want to share some of the questions with you here. Please let me know if you have any follow-up questions or comments or think there is anything the needs clarification. Hopefully we can approach this series together as an ongoing learning process!

      <description>If you read last week&#39;s post on standing qigong and the Energy Gates book, or better yet, you can stand comfortably &#34;just feeling&#34; for 15-20 minutes, you&#39;re probably ready to embark on the downward dissolving process.
This week, I want to help you get started.
I recorded a guided practice mp3 to get you through the first workout in the Energy Gates series: Feeling the Gate at the Crown of the Head.</description>

      <title>Form Versus Feel in Standing Qigong</title>
      <link>https://dankleiman.com/2014/01/09/form-versus-feel-in-standing-qigong/</link>

      <description>When you set out to develop your internal energy using standing postures, there are two main ways you can go about it: by feel or by form.
Now, there will be a lot of overlap in these two broad approaches, like aligning your body with gravity without collapsing internally and progressively releasing and relaxing as you stand, but when it comes to the role of the mind, form and feel can be very different.</description>

      <description>Feng Zhiqiang was a famous Tai Chi Master from Beijing who was a major influence on my teacher Bruce Frantzis. Master Feng did some teaching in the West as well and we are fortunate to have access to a transcript of a 2001 workshop he taught in the Bay Area (thanks to the folks at SilkReeler.com for making this transcript available and thanks to Igor for sending it my way!).</description>

      <title>Follow-Up Questions on Standing Qigong</title>

      <description>I was thrilled to receive such a positive response to my last post on Standing Qigong. And it wasn&#39;t just support, even though I confessed that now I have to climb back up the mountain on the way to 2-hour sessions again.
You guys asked really great questions about standing qigong.
Instead of answering them in the comments of the last post, I decided to turn the questions into a post of their own.</description>

      <title>Standing Qigong Breathing Exercises -- Mp3</title>
      <link>https://dankleiman.com/2013/06/27/standing-qigong-breathing-exercises-mp3/</link>

      <description>The biggest question people ask me about standing qigong, especially when they hear about the 2-hour project, is &#34;what do you do, just stand there?&#34;
There is actually a really delicate balance between &#34;doing&#34; and &#34;feeling&#34; when you stand. You learn lots of different techniques, like breathing, sinking, dissolving, and pulsing, but how you apply them internally when you are holding a static posture is a tricky topic.
If you rev your engine too much -- activating strong diaphragmatic breathing the entire time, for example -- then you miss the potential stillness in the posture.</description>

      <title>How to Shift Your Sense of Time in Standing Qigong</title>

      <description>Last month, we discussed the sense of progress you can sometimes struggle with in your practice. At the time, I mentioned that I&#39;ve been working up to a two-hour standing session, which is a very structured practice goal.
Today, I wanted to report back about what I&#39;ve been experiencing in standing qigong and show you how to shift your sense of the time that passes when you stand. The structure of adding one minute to the length of the stand each day is seems like it should make for a very linear sense of time when you practice.</description>
