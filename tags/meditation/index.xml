      <description>I want to thank everyone who took the time to answer this poll about meditation practice. You shared some really nice insights into what you experience and why you practice.
In this post, I want to share some of the common themes and the particular language people used to express what happens in a typical meditation practice session.
Body-Centered Meditation Practice
The first big theme was how physically oriented many people are in their practice.</description>

      <description>I was talking to a friend last night about standing qigong and different meditation traditions that we had both tried.
When we say &#34;meditation&#34; in this context, we were including all practices like breathing for relaxation, Tai Chi, qigong, and sitting practices too. Part of what I&#39;d like to hear from you (see below) is how you define &#34;meditation&#34; in a way that&#39;s practical and part of your everyday life.</description>

      <description>In this episode of Qigong Radio, Energy Arts Senior Instructor Paul Cavel explains the 3 different layers of neigong practice:
 Beginner or Foundational Practices -- Dragon and Tiger, Opening the Energy Gates, and Heaven and Earth Intermediate or Power-Production Practices -- Spiraling Energy Body and Bend the Bow Advanced or Integration Practices -- Gods Playing in the Clouds

Paul explains what to focus on at each level and how your learning spiral takes you back through them over time.</description>

      <title>Putting The Mind Inside The Body with Cathy Kerr</title>
      <link>https://dankleiman.com/2012/06/11/putting-the-mind-inside-the-body-with-cathy-kerr/</link>

      <description>What do we mean when we say we &#34;put our mind inside our body&#34; when we meditate, do qigong, or Tai Chi?
Dr. Cathy Kerr helps us understand this question from the perspective of modern neuroscience. In addition to being a Tai Chi practitioner, Cathy is the Director of Translational Neuroscience at Contemplative Studies Initiative and an Assistant Professor in the Department of Family Medicine at Brown University.
Drawing on a growing body of research from mindfulness meditation, her own work on sensory processes, and ancient texts, Cathy explains these Eastern practices develop your Western brain in areas that span physical health as well as mental and emotional well-being.</description>

      <description>The most popular discussion topic in the Inner Form coaching section for April was the question of how to integrate qigong and meditation.
The original poster asked, &#34;What are the benefits of doing qigong prior to meditation? I would think that doing qigong before meditation would help to have a deeper meditation practice and vice versa? Is this true ? Does it depend on the set or practice you are doing?</description>

      <description>Have you ever tried to meditate? You sit down, close your eyes, and try to drop into a deep state of focus and relaxation....but you start thinking about a million different things, from what you have to do later today, to a fight you just had, to that itch on your leg that gets louder and louder....Given the way we are constantly bombarded by images and electronic messages, it&#39;s not really surprising that you can&#39;t quiet your &#34;</description>

      <description>I just started working with Bruce&#39;s new meditation program. I&#39;m very excited to hear him framing this home-study series in terms of rhythms, pacing, and long term development. Every couple of weeks he&#39;s putting out new guided practice recordings, which I think will be easy to follow-through on and fresh enough to keep people tuned into their practice. I&#39;ll let you know how it goes!
