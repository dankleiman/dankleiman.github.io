      <description>&lt;p&gt;I want to thank everyone who took the time to answer &lt;a href=&#34;https://dankleiman.wufoo.com/forms/what-does-it-feel-like-when-you-meditate/&#34;&gt;this poll about meditation practice&lt;/a&gt;. You shared some really nice insights into what you experience and why you practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I want to share some of the common themes and the particular language people used to express what happens in a typical meditation practice session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Body-Centered Meditation Practice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The first big theme was how physically oriented many people are in their practice. Here&#39;s one description that captured the body-centered practice well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first process is of physically settling in, sitting or standing . After a few minutes, mental calm will follow, then more or less in order physical releasing and smoothing out, then emotional smoothing, lastly nervous smoothing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
And other description of the process, again anchored by a connection to the physical body:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The way it goes is more or less always the same: it begins easily, then when I start to really get into some spot that needs attention, things can become quite painful, or unnerving. Then there&#39;s often the part when things seem to take hours to resolve, and I have to stick to it and really discipline myself not to let my attention jump around. Then I get some sort of release, and it starts feeling good. By the end of the session, once the body has been completely scanned and I&#39;ve gone through the moving parts of the set, my body feels all light and fluid.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Overall, there seemed to be an assumption that body-centered practice was not the same as &#34;higher-level&#34; esoteric practice. At the same time, many people recognized the immediacy of addressing the physical body in their practice. At the top of the list for many people was a clear benefit for the body:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I almost always get is physical relaxation and a better sleep.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In the past, we&#39;ve explored &lt;a title=&#34;Common Sensations That Arise When You Are Developing Chi&#34; href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/2013/01/15/common-sensations-that-arise-when-you-are-developing-chi/&#34;&gt;the energetic continuum from the physical body out to more subtle frequencies&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps the way that this continuum is organized gives us some clues. You can&#39;t address the more ethereal aspects of your self and your relationships to other people without being grounded in a healthy physical body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Meditation for Being in the World&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In fact, some of the descriptions of meditation practice blended the physical and relational dimensions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unwinding the work day is like softening a tight muscle.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Or having a clear dual purpose:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the feeling I start with is one of looking for a practical way to recharge and be able to bring it into my daily life. When the session is over I usually feel mentally flexible and physically accepting of my bodily discomfort.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
And even when the goal is more along the lines of emotional or mental, like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I began to practice because I wanted to be a calmer person,&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
there is still a sense of bringing the body back into the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Striving for Perfect Practice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Now, many people also wrestled with how well their practice was going. Perhaps the clearest articulation of the dilemma of progress in meditation was expressed here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This almost seems like a trick question because I believe that the mediation sessions that are the most frustrating, annoying, painful, etc, are the better sessions for me. If I have what I think is a &#34;good&#34; session, that&#39;s usually a dead end. I&#39;m happy with myself and that&#39;s it for the day. If I have a &#34;bad&#34; session, that seems to be more helpful in moving me in the direction of greater consciousness, mentally, physically and emotionally. Putting that aside, the result my ego likes most and considers a good session, is a reduction in tension. My body becomes more relaxed and as a result I can feel more. My thought becomes more relaxed and the repetitive chatter slows down and stops for longer periods of time. As a result I can think much clearer and work much better. Emotionally, I don&#39;t react to negativity around me as quickly and can avoid getting caught up in it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
And sometimes, you go through a process of working on one dimension or another of your practice, and get to a place where the practice is just an essential, but everyday part of your life:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34; id=&#34;docs-internal-guid-36aad5fa-1eae-6247-cab7-7512c26258cf&#34;&gt;Originally I started meditating when becoming aware of the racing thoughts in my mind and wanting to eliminate them. Of course, it did not take too long to realize there is no eliminating those thoughts as they arise but that the real benefit was to become the observer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Over time and the practice of different Qigong, the experience deepened and now becomes a way to realize a type of wholeness or unity or synergy with everything, that transcends the focus on what to get done today, body awareness of hunger/pain/etc, and the other things we associate with being human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, now the emotional attachments to what I considered a &#34;good meditation&#34; have left as well. Where before I might have considered having a meditation where I transcended the universe of matter and anti-matter and found the crack between realities some kind of big deal, I now can just accept that it happened (or didn&#39;t) without any judgement, joy, elation, etc.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Do these experiences line up for you? What did I miss in trying to capture the language around meditation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems like &lt;a href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/2013/01/07/the-transformational-power-of-tai-chi-body-mechanics/&#34;&gt;Wu Jianquan&#39;s advice on practicing Tai Chi&lt;/a&gt; also applies to much of the meditation practice that people reported on here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. CHARACTER TRANSFORMATION&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When emptiness becomes a habit, it causes you to have a milder temperament and can eliminate arrogant behaviors. When calmness becomes a habit, it causes you to have a clearer mental state, increasing your ability to deal with problems. When naturalness becomes a habit and your body has a smooth coordination, it causes you to have a more robust build, which gives you a more leisurely attitude. When softness becomes a habit, it causes you to have a friendlier disposition, giving you more confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. INCREASED INSPIRATION&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because every part of the Taiji boxing art contains scientific principles [This seems an airy claim since there is no specific scientific analysis in this book, but becomes more reasonable when taken in the context of the larger body of Taiji literature: for example, Xu Zhiyi&#39;s 1927 book contains three chapters exploring Taiji&#39;s relation to psychology, physiology, and physics.], and also due to its alternations of emptiness and fullness, it is a method that is inexhaustible. When practicing the solo set, the whole body feels comfortable, and when practicing the pushing hands, the whole body feels enlivened. Therefore after practicing for a while, not only will one not feel tired, but one&#39;s spirit will also feel awakened, a clear demonstration of one&#39;s sense of interest being boosted. However, for beginners, because they have not yet become familiar with the map that will lead them to their destinations, they easily begin to get bored, and they must be patient for a period, after which they naturally will gradually come to find the more scenic vistas of sensation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Poll: What Does It Feel Like When You Meditate?</title>
      <link>/dankleiman.github.io/2013/05/24/poll-what-does-it-feel-like-when-you-meditate/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 24 May 2013 09:58:24 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/dankleiman.github.io/2013/05/24/poll-what-does-it-feel-like-when-you-meditate/</guid>
      <description>&lt;img class=&#34;alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-4629&#34; alt=&#34;help-browser&#34; src=&#34;dankleiman.github.io/uploads/2013/05/help-browser-150x150.png&#34; width=&#34;150&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was talking to a friend last night about &lt;a title=&#34;Guide to Standing Qigong&#34; href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/exercises/guide-to-standing-qigong/&#34;&gt;standing qigong&lt;/a&gt; and different &lt;a title=&#34;3 Layers of Neigong Practice and Taoist Meditation with Paul Cavel&#34; href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/2013/01/29/3-layers-of-neigong-practice-and-taoist-meditation-with-paul-cavel/&#34;&gt;meditation traditions&lt;/a&gt; that we had both tried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we say &#34;meditation&#34; in this context, we were including all practices like breathing for relaxation, Tai Chi, qigong, and sitting practices too. Part of what I&#39;d like to hear from you (see below) is how you define &#34;meditation&#34; in a way that&#39;s practical and part of your everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were many different reasons, on any given day, that we sought out the practice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To clear our heads of racing thoughts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To more deeply relax the body.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To explore layers of the mind and emotions that aren&#39;t so obvious during our normal busy days.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It seems like we had really similar reasons to practice, but I was left wondering if it &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; similar when we practice. What are the sensations that tell you you&#39;re on the right track? It seems like we want to end up in the same place, but are we taking the same road to get there?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>3 Layers of Neigong Practice and Taoist Meditation with Paul Cavel</title>
      <link>/dankleiman.github.io/2013/01/29/3-layers-of-neigong-practice-and-taoist-meditation-with-paul-cavel/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 29 Jan 2013 07:00:50 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/dankleiman.github.io/2013/01/29/3-layers-of-neigong-practice-and-taoist-meditation-with-paul-cavel/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this episode of Qigong Radio, Energy Arts Senior Instructor &lt;a href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/tag/paul-cavel/&#34;&gt;Paul Cavel&lt;/a&gt; explains the 3 different layers of neigong practice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beginner or Foundational Practices&lt;/strong&gt; -- Dragon and Tiger, Opening the Energy Gates, and Heaven and Earth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intermediate or Power-Production Practices&lt;/strong&gt; -- Spiraling Energy Body and Bend the Bow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advanced or Integration Practices&lt;/strong&gt; -- Gods Playing in the Clouds&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter  wp-image-4491&#34; alt=&#34;3 Layers of Neigong&#34; src=&#34;dankleiman.github.io/uploads/2013/01/for_danny-1024x483.jpg&#34; width=&#34;717&#34; height=&#34;338&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Paul explains what to focus on at each level and how your learning spiral takes you back through them over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I found Paul&#39;s explanation of the relationships between the sets particularly useful. Specifically, understanding &lt;a title=&#34;Opening the Energy Gates by Bruce Frantzis is The Most Important Qigong Book To Have in Your Library&#34; href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/2011/10/31/opening-the-energy-gates-by-bruce-frantzis-is-the-most-important-qigong-book-to-have-in-your-library/&#34;&gt;Energy Gates&lt;/a&gt; as direct preparation for &lt;a title=&#34;Spiraling Energy Body Qigong with Isaac Kamins&#34; href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/2012/05/28/spiraling-energy-body-qigong-with-isaac-kamins/&#34;&gt;Spiraling&lt;/a&gt; -- first you clear the downward flow of chi, then you strengthen the upward flow. Similarly, in &lt;a href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/tag/heaven-and-earth/&#34;&gt;Heaven and Earth&lt;/a&gt; you learn to expand the body (through opening/closing the joints and lengthening the soft tissue) before you really go into deep internal compression in &lt;a href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/tag/bend-the-bow/&#34;&gt;Bend the Bow&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we discussed the meaning of &#34;integration,&#34; Paul explained how neigong is the basis for Taoist meditation and where neigong shows up inside your meditation practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the episode, we talk about the great training resources available on &lt;a href=&#34;http://paulcavel.com&#34;&gt;PaulCavel.com&lt;/a&gt;, including the Inner Quest Journal (&lt;a title=&#34;Recommended Products&#34; href=&#34;https://dankleiman.wufoo.com/forms/q7p5x7/&#34;&gt;download a free issue here&lt;/a&gt;). If you get the chance, please let Paul know how much we all appreciate the high quality material he is putting out.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Putting The Mind Inside The Body with Cathy Kerr</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34; wp-image-3981 &#34; title=&#34;Dr. Cathy Kerr&#34; src=&#34;dankleiman.github.io/uploads/2012/06/large_catherine.kerr_.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Dr. Cathy Kerr&#34; width=&#34;200&#34; height=&#34;200&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do we mean when we say we &#34;put our mind inside our body&#34; when we meditate, do qigong, or Tai Chi?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Cathy Kerr helps us understand this question from the perspective of modern neuroscience. In addition to being a Tai Chi practitioner, Cathy is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://brown.academia.edu/CatherineKerr&#34;&gt;Director of Translational Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt; at Contemplative Studies Initiative and an Assistant Professor in the Department of Family Medicine at Brown University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing on a growing body of research from mindfulness meditation, her own work on sensory processes, and ancient texts, Cathy explains these Eastern practices develop your Western brain in areas that span physical health as well as mental and emotional well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a id=&#34;more&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;more-3980&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What Are The Benefits Of Doing Qigong Prior To Meditation?</title>
      <link>/dankleiman.github.io/2012/05/07/what-are-the-benefits-of-doing-qigong-prior-to-meditation/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 07 May 2012 06:00:06 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/dankleiman.github.io/2012/05/07/what-are-the-benefits-of-doing-qigong-prior-to-meditation/</guid>
      <description>&lt;img class=&#34;alignleft size-medium wp-image-3864&#34; title=&#34;Stake Standing&#34; src=&#34;dankleiman.github.io/uploads/2012/05/Stake-Standing-200x300.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Standing Qigong as Prep for Meditation&#34; width=&#34;200&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most popular discussion topic in the &lt;a title=&#34;Inner Form Coaching&#34; href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/inner-form/&#34;&gt;Inner Form coaching section&lt;/a&gt; for April was the question of how to integrate qigong and meditation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original poster asked, &#34;What are the benefits of doing qigong prior to meditation? I would think that doing qigong before meditation would help to have a deeper meditation practice and vice versa? Is this true ? Does it depend on the set or practice you are doing? What should one consider?&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different members shared their experience and advice for working through the practice dilemma.&lt;a id=&#34;more&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;more-3862&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One said, &#34;it makes sense that both practices complement/amplify each other at the physical and chi body levels (physical health) although meditation is of course also geared for higher level development. I read somewhere that if, for whatever reason, you are intending a longer meditation than qigong practice then doing qigong first is advised and vice versa. Is there any merit in allocating equal time to each (appreciating that for varying reasons the depth and effectiveness of each practice will vary from day to day regardless of time spent)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As to whether particular qigong sets vary in their relevance to meditation, I guess there must be some significance. &#39;Gods&#39; is listed as being a &#39;bridge&#39; to meditation and I&#39;ve heard it described as shen (spiritual) gong by some. Standing and Outer Dissolving are part of Energy Gates so it would seem there must be some sense of progression from Energy Gates to seated meditation. I wonder whether Dragon and Tiger might be appropriate if one of the aims of meditation is related to healing.&lt;br /&gt;
If one&#39;s movement practice is very much oriented towards a meditative approach then perhaps alternating between seated, standing and moving modes has merit &amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&#34; how much does order really matter?&lt;br /&gt;
In my own daily practice I try and do a full set of &#39;Gods&#39; before meditating in the morning &amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&#34; I&#39;m currently following &lt;a title=&#34;Bruce Frantzis&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade; New Taoist Meditation Circle&#34; href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/2011/02/17/bruce-frantzis-new-taoist-meditation-circle/&#34;&gt;Bruce&#39;s Meditation Circle&lt;/a&gt; course. I do other &#39;random&#39; mini and micro practices as and when during the day and evening. At weekends I follow the meditation with a break, and then &#39;Dragon and Tiger&#39;, followed by another break and then Tai Chi if chores permit. I don&#39;t tend to look at/think about the time unless there are external constraints. &#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From another member: &#34;This is a riddle that i play with nearly every morning, if time permits. &amp;Acirc; For my own sanity, if only have time for one practice, I&#39;ll do meditation. &amp;Acirc; I have been doing Buddhist zazen for forty years, so it is clear to me how much this practice does to ease my suffering&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&#34;and that of the people I connect with during the day, thanks to the way it creates space around judging myself and others, and how it helps release the need to always be busy. If there is time, I generally do some simple qigong practice first&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&#34;sometimes just circling hands, often Marriage of H&amp;amp;E, sometimes the first two moves of Gods with the fourth for grounding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often when I start sitting, I will hold my hands off at my sides&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&#34;I sit in a chair due to hip problems, and alternately press down and release my hands to help my body ground. &amp;Acirc; Sometimes, but not always, I will open and close my hands and feet and top of the head lightly for the first few minutes of sitting, before just letting that go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My own sense is that the qigong helps to minimize the risk of just &#34;dead sitting&#34; that can happen when folks become tight and dry in their meditating.&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;Acirc; The point of potential problem for qigongers meditating is that usually there is a sense when doing qigong that something is being generated, that something is improving. In meditating, at least Buddhist style, the root practice is allowing oneself to feel complete no matter how shattered, incomplete, hopeless, depleted, dry or inattentive one may feel. &amp;Acirc; For one small period in one&#39;s daily life, one is not practicing self improvement. &amp;Acirc; Not that qigongers might not also practice this way, but generally my experience has been that this is not the usual mode.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And another perspective: &#34;I like to do sinking or dissolving and qigong usually cloud hands and spine stretch when I have any time. I have been involved in the Taoist meditation circle for 3 months or so. I like to use the month current module and then I will practice a previous one after. I have found the module 4 very helpful. It releases tension stored in my internal images and inner dialogue. &lt;strong&gt;These greatly enhance my overall practice as well as release a kind of overall tension that is a great relief and gives me a feeling of not being stuck and being able to move forward.&lt;/strong&gt; I feel like before I wasted tons of energy just sort of hitting my head against patterns of thought and tension which now seems like I&#39;m installing ways to move on to more productive ways to be.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some real gems in this discussion, like the way you can energize your sitting with qigong and the insight about just letting go of whatever comes up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you establish a regular practice rhythm, you can think about this question on a weekly, monthly, or seasonal scale too, not just the daily sessions. When the rhythm is strong, you feel the effects of the practice on other areas &amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&#34; like qigong on sitting &amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&#34; without worrying about doing them in the same session. You&#39;re priming larger energetic rhythms and waking up inside, which carries over between practice sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is the direction your practice is heading in, come join the discussion in the Inner Form session. As you can tell from the comments, there are dedicated, knowledgeable practitioners eager to share their experiences with each other and we always welcome new voices in the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Meditation for People Who Can&#39;t Sit Still</title>

      <description>&lt;img class=&#34;alignleft size-medium wp-image-1645&#34; title=&#34;Morning Practice&#34; src=&#34;dankleiman.github.io/uploads/2011/06/shutterstock_13634416-300x199.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;210&#34; height=&#34;139&#34; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you ever tried to meditate? You sit down, close your eyes, and try to drop into a deep state of focus and relaxation....but you start thinking about a million different things, from what you have to do later today, to a fight you just had, to that itch on your leg that gets louder and louder....Given the way we are constantly bombarded by images and electronic messages, it&#39;s not really surprising that you can&#39;t quiet your &#34;monkey mind&#34; by trying to sit and forget it. &lt;a id=&#34;more&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;more-2965&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is, there&#39;s a way to build your capacity to go deeply into meditation, by doing some preliminary training that will quiet your mind without a fight. Think of a baseball player who is too weak to lift a bat. Is he ever going to hit a home run? Of course not. So he gets into the weight room to build up some muscle. At first he gets strong enough to lift the bat, then maybe swing it, then eventually he&#39;s strong enough to swing and run. At this point, he&#39;s got a baseline where he can actually start to work on his baseball technique. Lifting weights and playing his sport aren&#39;t the same thing, but one can support the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of meditation the same way. If you actually want to improve your meditation technique, your &#34;meditation muscles&#34; have to be strong enough to get you in the game. And what&#39;s the equivalent of hitting the weights for people who can&#39;t sit still long enough to meditate? Tai chi, of course!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tai Chi is Not Meditation, But It Builds Meditation Muscle&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Many people confuse tai chi with a meditation practice, because of its slow, &lt;em&gt;meditative&lt;/em&gt; movements. Tai Chi is not necessarily meditation. Yes, it&#39;s true that in some lineages meditation techniques have been grafted on to the tai chi form. This works because the energy work in tai chi originally comes from Taoist energy mechanics, which naturally evolve toward meditation. However, tai chi as it typically practiced is concerned with the health of the physical body and the energy that runs it, and possibly with the energy of the emotions and the mind to a degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know this seems like a fine distinction and you&#39;re probably wondering why you should care about it. &#34;Tai Chi makes me feel good, relaxed and comfortable inside my own body.&#34; Personally, I think that&#39;s great. The distinction between developing the energy of your body (tai chi) and developing the energy of your mind and spirit (meditation) is useful as you practice. Think of the baseball player again. If he thinks that endless hours in the weight room are going to make him into an all-star hitter, is he ever going to get there? He&#39;s chasing the wrong thing. Because you have limited practice time, you should care about practice goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for the person who can&#39;t sit still, but wants to meditate, keeping this distinction in mind will speed up their progress (because we know tai chi and meditation are all about results!). See, if you do tai chi to smooth out the energy of your body, you inevitably start working on your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You develop four major qualities that will come in handy when you turn to meditation directly:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ability to expand your awareness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ability to soften your mind and let things flow into your awareness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ability to direct your intent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ability to stay with something as it shifts and changes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When you can&#39;t quite sit still enough to meditate, either your body isn&#39;t relaxed enough or you&#39;re lacking in one of these four qualities. The beautiful thing about learning tai chi to help your meditation practice is that &#34;it meets you half-way&#34;. You&#39;re developing these qualities initially in a moving practice, which is more forgiving than a stillness practice, so even if the energy of your body isn&#39;t that smooth yet, you can start down the path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;For More Experienced Meditators&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For more experienced meditators, tai chi is also incredibly valuable. Many people who do prolonged sitting practice don&#39;t have a way to keep the energy of their bodies running smoothly. As opposed to doing any other form of exercise to keep the body healthy, tai chi is a two-for-one.&amp;Acirc;  You&#39;re circulating the energy of the body while you practice, but you&#39;re also developing the four attributes above, which will strengthen your meditation practice as well.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just started working with Bruce&#39;s new meditation program. I&#39;m very excited to hear him framing this home-study series in terms of rhythms, pacing, and long term development. &lt;a id=&#34;more&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;more-627&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Every couple of weeks he&#39;s putting out new guided practice recordings, which I think will be easy to follow-through on and fresh enough to keep people tuned into their practice. I&#39;ll let you know how it goes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.energyarts.com/content/taoist-meditation-circle-subscription&#34;&gt;Taoist Meditation Circle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#34;Get out of your head and into your body.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
