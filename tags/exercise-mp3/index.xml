      <description>The biggest question people ask me about standing qigong, especially when they hear about the 2-hour project, is &#34;what do you do, just stand there?&#34;
There is actually a really delicate balance between &#34;doing&#34; and &#34;feeling&#34; when you stand. You learn lots of different techniques, like breathing, sinking, dissolving, and pulsing, but how you apply them internally when you are holding a static posture is a tricky topic.
If you rev your engine too much -- activating strong diaphragmatic breathing the entire time, for example -- then you miss the potential stillness in the posture.</description>
