      <description>I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m more excited about the video series, the fact that we&#39;re inches away from the private beta launch, or that I can embed all the videos in one of Viddler&#39;s &#34;vidgets&#34;. Check them out:</description>

      <description>I spent a fair amount of time today migrating, connecting, and updating. Over the last month or so, I&#39;ve been building out a wordpress front-end site for Trainerfly.

The Ba Gua Mastery Program is a home-study program with information on circle-walking for meditation and martial arts.</description>
