      <description>At this time of year, you hear a lot about New Year&#39;s resolutions.
This year, I was happy to see a lot of people saying &#34;New Year&#39;s resolutions don&#39;t work.&#34; We all know that&#39;s true from personal experience, but these folks were referencing a growing understanding about how learning and skill-building take place. Most of what we now know about how the nervous system works flies in the face of changing through the strength of your willpower alone.</description>

      <description>I got an email the other day that was a little bit different than the usual requests for lessons. It read:
&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;oelig;I learned the Short Form at Brookline Tai Chi under the tutelage of Bill Ryan back about 1996-1997. For seven years, I continued to do the short form three times every morning. Then for the past eight years or so, I have done the short form four times every morning.</description>

      <description>Even if you have cultivated a daily practice that takes you into deep relaxation, it&#39;s helpful to have a set of stress reduction techniques &#34;that work in 5 minutes or less.&#34;
You can pull these out during the day when you have a few minutes of downtime. If you are busy and really stressed out, these relaxation techniques can prevent your stress level from going through the roof.
Try them and let me know what you think.</description>

      <title>4 Practice Partners You Should Avoid</title>
      <link>https://dankleiman.com/2011/10/17/4-practice-partners-you-should-avoid/</link>

      <description>The next time you go to class, watch out for these 4 practice partners. While they all start out with good intentions, if you hang out with them too much, you&#39;ll get sucked into their quirky habits and slow down your own progress. Don&#39;t say I didn&#39;t warn you!

Checklist Charlie is the tai chi student who is forever stuck in his own head. Every time he practices, instead of feeling his body, he recites a list of stuff he is supposed to be doing.</description>

      <description>Z-Health Master Trainer Jen Waak is a self-described &#34;recovering management consultant&#34;. These days, she helps other &#34;Keyboard Athletes&#34; improve and maintain their bodies and stay healthy even when they&#39;re stuck behind a desk all day. What surprised me about reading Jen&#39;s advice on &#34;what you should do at your desk&#34;, was that it sounded a lot like what she did last year to get ready for a climb up Mount Kilimanjaro.</description>

      <title>Is Your Practice All in Your Head?</title>

      <description>As you&#39;re sitting here reading this, I want you to try something. I want you to push yourself back away from your desk, let your arms hang by your sides, close your eyes and see how many fingers you can feel. Go ahead, try it.
Now do the same thing again, but stand up and count your toes instead.
Could you feel more fingers or toes?
Chances are you have much greater feeling access to your fingers.</description>

      <title>Practice Twice a Day</title>
      <link>https://dankleiman.com/2011/09/01/practice-twice-a-day/</link>

      <description>So, I know I&#39;m writing this on vacation where the most pressing decision we make each day is whether to hike, kayak, or swim, but I&#39;m going to go ahead anyway and recommend that you practice twice a day. Here&#39;s why...

What I Learned from a Month-Long Tai Chi Intensive
After a month in England, practicing 10 hours a day at the Short Form Instructor Training this summer, I have a renewed appreciation for daily practice rhythm.</description>

      <title>Tai Chi for Weight Loss?</title>
      <link>https://dankleiman.com/2011/08/08/tai-chi-for-weight-loss/</link>

      <guid>https://dankleiman.com/2011/08/08/tai-chi-for-weight-loss/</guid>
      <description>People often ask me if tai chi is good for losing weight. If they&#39;re asking whether tai chi is a substitute for running or lifting weights, the answer is usually &#34;no&#34;. When someone has been really injury or hasn&#39;t exercised in a long time, tai chi can get you back on your feet and moving pain free. For these folks, tai chi can be a safe first step towards more demanding exercise.</description>

      <title>How Do I Sequence My Practice Sets for Qigong and Tai Chi?</title>

      <description>If I&#39;m going to practice several types of qigong and maybe some tai chi, does it matter what order I do things in? Or if I do one longer practice vs two shorter ones during the day?</description>

      <title>How to Practice Qigong According to My Wife</title>
      <link>https://dankleiman.com/2011/07/18/how-to-practice-qigong-according-to-my-wife/</link>

      <guid>https://dankleiman.com/2011/07/18/how-to-practice-qigong-according-to-my-wife/</guid>
      <description>I learned everything I know about practicing qigong from my wife. Or I should say, from watching my wife make magic in the kitchen! If you saw us cooking together, you&#39;d see her doing everything right and me doing everything wrong. When I started to practice qigong the way she cooks, my whole qigong world changed. Let me tell you how.
What I do: I read every recipe word for word and line by line.</description>

      <title>30 Day Better Breathing Challenge</title>

      <description>Recently, I&#39;ve been talking a lot about two things, improving your breathing to give you a major energy/relaxation boost and developing tools that help you follow-through on your home practice. I&#39;ve even created an online course with all the information you need to cultivate better breathing habits: Better Breathing. The biggest lesson we learned as we talked to BTC students&amp;Acirc; was that the best time to use reminders to trigger your practice was when you were invested in learning a new skill.</description>

      <title>Accessing Quiet Awareness with Lee Burkins</title>

      <description>In June, between sessions at Brookline Tai Chi and during master classes with Bruce Frantzis, a small group of students got a special treat. Energy Arts Senior Instructor Lee Burkins was in town to train with Bruce, and on one of the nights off, he offered a special evening course on a topic he calls &#34;Investing in Loss&#34;.
What I love about studying with someone like Lee is that he&#39;s a practitioner whose art has soaked so deeply into his bones, that it practically oozes out of his DNA.</description>

      <description>By training the principles of body-alignment and movement as described in the Tai Chi Classics, you can move with much more grace, fluidity, and power. Instead of wasting energy holding excess tension, relaxation can lead the way to more powerful movement. Here&#39;s what Yang Cheng-fu said about it a hundred years ago (the following is adapted from YANG&#39;S TEN IMPORTANT POINTS by Yang Cheng-fu (1883 &amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&#34; 1936) as researched by Lee N.</description>

      <title>Why Do You Have a Home Practice?</title>

      <description>When we started asking our students at Brookline Tai Chi about their home practice, we got a really interesting range of habits and preferences. Since then, we&#39;ve been trying out different tools to help spark more home practice. Stepping back for a minute, I&#39;d really like to know more about why you practice. Take a minute drop me a line (filing out the form below is private and goes right to me, no one else).</description>

      <title>DIY Home Practice Challenge</title>
      <link>https://dankleiman.com/2011/06/06/diy-home-practice-challenge/</link>

      <description>From the recent practice survey we conducted at Brookline Tai Chi and experiments I&#39;ve been running in online learning, it&#39;s become clearer and clearer to me that most people need some external motivation when they are learning a new skill. That&#39;s not a judgment about willpower and motivation, it actually says more about the way we are wired for survival. In Z Health, we always talk about the way that the nervous system is at once the most plastic system -- it can adapt to lots of different changes -- and also the most stable.</description>
