      <description>I want to thank everyone who took the time to answer this poll about meditation practice. You shared some really nice insights into what you experience and why you practice.
In this post, I want to share some of the common themes and the particular language people used to express what happens in a typical meditation practice session.
Body-Centered Meditation Practice
The first big theme was how physically oriented many people are in their practice.</description>

      <description>I was talking to a friend last night about standing qigong and different meditation traditions that we had both tried.
When we say &#34;meditation&#34; in this context, we were including all practices like breathing for relaxation, Tai Chi, qigong, and sitting practices too. Part of what I&#39;d like to hear from you (see below) is how you define &#34;meditation&#34; in a way that&#39;s practical and part of your everyday life.</description>
