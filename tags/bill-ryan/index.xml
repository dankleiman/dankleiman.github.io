      <description>When learning qigong or Tai Chi, people are often either more tuned into to energy or to their physical bodies. In this episode of Qigong Radio, I asked my first qigong and Tai Chi teacher, Energy Arts Senior Instructor and founder of Brookline Tai Chi, Bill Ryan to explain why this is.
More importantly, Bill teaches you how to navigate the experiences of developing your internal energy, regardless of how you first become aware of them.</description>
