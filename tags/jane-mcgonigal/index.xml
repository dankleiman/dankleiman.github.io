      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; Recently, TechCrunch featured an article about &lt;a href=&#34;http://techcrunch.com/2010/08/25/scvngr-game-mechanics/&#34;&gt;the playdeck they use at SCVNGR&lt;/a&gt; that outlines the mechanics of gameplay. The article cites at TED talk by game designer Jane McGonigal, which I talk about &lt;a href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/2011/01/03/epic-meaning-sheep-knuckles-and-the-institute-for-the-future/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;more&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;more-538&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I was a little disappointed with McGonigal&#39;s conclusion, because she basically offered up the solution as specially-themed video games to leverage the power of game mechanics, or &#34;gameplay superpowers&#34;, to do good in the real world and incite behavior change. She presented a couple of case studies that her group ran and they showed some carry-over to behaviors later on. That&#39;s fine. I just think there&#39;s potential to go further. I don&#39;t think I was alone either. If you read the TED video comments, lots of people reply with &#34;but my son lives in the basement and only comes out to eat&#34; arguments. Not exactly the thriving social fabric McGonigal presents....&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I couldn&#39;t help think that there are better examples of hybrids between real life behavior and motivation that falls under the game mechanics principles. The example I want to look at today is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.crossfit.com&#34;&gt;Crossfit&lt;/a&gt;. As a fitness movement, they do an amazing job with this blend. Now, I have to admit I don&#39;t have direct experience with Crossfit, so I&#39;m hoping someone who does will fill in even more detail here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Game Mechanics Defined&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When I refer to &#34;game mechanics&#34; in this post, I&#39;m taking about the underlying elements that are repeatedly used across interactive electronic media to elicit emotional, motivating responses from the game players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the TechCrunch article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;SCVNGR&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;s playdeck tries to break down the game mechanics into their  constituent parts.  Some elements are as basic as &amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;oelig;achievements,&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;  &amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;oelig;status,&amp;acirc;&amp;euro; and &amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;oelig;virtual items.&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;   But there are also more complex ones  such as the &amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;oelig;appointment dynamic&amp;acirc;&amp;euro; (a player must return at a specific  time and perform an action to get a reward, like in Farmville), &amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;oelig;free  lunch&amp;acirc;&amp;euro; (a player gets something because of the efforts of other  people,like in Groupon), &amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;oelig;fun once, fun always&amp;acirc;&amp;euro; (a simple action that  maintains a minimum level of enjoyment no matter how many times you do  it, like Foursquare&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;s check-ins), and &amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;oelig;cascading information theory  (give out information in the smallest dribblets possible to keep players  guessing and moving forward).&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We&#39;re going to look at how these dynamics are used, intentionally or not (I don&#39;t know), in the user experience on Crossfit.com, at Crossfit affiliate gyms, and in the Crossfit Games. It&#39;s also important to look at overarching concepts in gameplay, that Jane McGonigal has articulated very clearly in her TED talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Game Mechanics in Crossfit&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I believe that the following mechanisms make the Crossfit user experience engaging and as a result, extremely popular. If you get confused about where I&#39;m using technical terms, refer back to &lt;a href=&#34;http://techcrunch.com/2010/08/25/scvngr-game-mechanics/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;the TechCrunch article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Companion Gaming&lt;/strong&gt; -- the cross-platform approach is central to the idea of applying game mechanics from the virtual world to real world behavior. Crossfit does this by posting the &#34;workout of the day&#34; to Crossfit.com, allowing affiliate gyms to operate Crossfit locations, and even hosting an Olympics-style Crossfit Games. You can &#34;play&#34; in all these different ways, and your achievements in one venue is relevant to another. More on that below...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appointment Dynamic &lt;/strong&gt;-- at the heart of Crossfit.com is the &#34;Workout of the Day&#34;. Each day, a challenging workout is posted from Crossfit headquarters that sets the daily goal for everyone who participates. If you read the comments, where people post their workout times, you&#39;ll see a mix of dread and delight, which seems to capture the Crossfit spirit. So, all wrapped up in this daily challenge is also:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Achievement&lt;/strong&gt; -- posting your times to comments,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Countdown&lt;/strong&gt; -- workouts are often completed &#34;for time&#34;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pride&lt;/strong&gt; -- successful completion of the workout or beating your own previous time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Envy &lt;/strong&gt;-- daily workouts are often accompanied by pictures of other Crossfitters working out in various states of undress&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy &lt;/strong&gt;-- leveraging public accountability, i.e. posting your achievement, to motivate future compliance&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
These underlying mechanics add up to create what McGonigal refers to as the &#34;Social Fabric of Games&#34;. In other words, competition creates community. McGonigal captures the gamer spirit alive in the social fabric as an &#34;urgent optimism&#34; to toil in &#34;blissful productivity&#34; towards &#34;epic meaning&#34;. Again, watch the video to get her full explication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point though, you really need to ask two questions. First of all, you&#39;re probably wondering why these mechanics can be apparently more compelling than real life. I&#39;m not sure if they are or whether a virtual world just gives us a clear view into how they work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second question is, given how powerful these motivators are, how can I incorporate them into my training business? Take another look at Crossfit. I know I&#39;ve barely scratched the surface with this analysis. And I&#39;m not saying you should copy their model. But you should think long and hard about how they&#39;ve grown an online epicenter out into tens of thousands of real life participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, I don&#39;t think that just because you can identify these mechanisms, it makes their use disingenuous,b ut I will caution you with one more principle from the gamer&#39;s playdeck: &lt;strong&gt;Beware the Moral Hazard of Game Play&lt;/strong&gt;. The Moral Hazard is, again from TC, &#34;the risk that by rewarding people manipulatively in a game you remove the actual moral value of the action and replace it with an ersatz game-based reward.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s in this final warning, though, that I find the truly satisfying answer to McGonigal&#39;s problem  and why I love the Crossfit example so much. When you really do come up with an elegant blend of real-world and virtual cross-platform companion gaming, you create the best motivation for the healthiest action. That is what I believe all movement educators should strive for.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Epic Meaning, Sheep Knuckles, and The Institute for the Future</title>
      <link>http://dankleiman.com/2011/01/03/epic-meaning-sheep-knuckles-and-the-institute-for-the-future/</link>

      <guid>http://dankleiman.com/2011/01/03/epic-meaning-sheep-knuckles-and-the-institute-for-the-future/</guid>
      <description>&lt;img class=&#34;alignleft size-medium wp-image-531&#34; title=&#34;gaming superpowers&#34; src=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/uploads/2011/01/gaming-superpowers-300x207.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;207&#34; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jane McGonigal gives a fascinating talk about the &#34;superpowers&#34; cultivated by the game-playing masses (more than 500 million with another billion coming up in the next decade!). Obviously we all have the image of the gamer locked in his mother&#39;s basement, endlessly pawing away at an electronic reward system, like a hamster. McGonigal&#39;s takeaway is a little different though.&lt;a id=&#34;more&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;more-528&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She emphasizes the motivation, inspiration, and social purpose built into game play. I think that&#39;s an interesting take. When I talked to an early pioneer of these games, he said that &#34;we knew they were addictive from the beginning&#34;, but it sounded like the dirty little secret that no one wanted to admit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I think the interesting question is whether the virtues of gaming (along the lines of motivation and engagement) can be transferred to real world activity without the addictive over-use that leads to unhealthy, sedentary life. Maybe as technology comes out of the basement and into the palm of your hand more readily, this is becoming a more reasonable goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, her talk is definitely worth watching (oh, and the sheep knuckles tie back nicely into Herodotus for a lesson on real world gaming!):&lt;/p&gt;
