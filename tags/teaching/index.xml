      <description>Last night I taught my last two weekly classes at Brookline Tai Chi.
Next month, I&#39;ll be diving into a new intensive learning experience, building software applications and learning about the web from a depth I&#39;ve only poked at up until now.
(I have some really cool stuff planned for Immersion Week too, so I&#39;m not quite done yet!)
It&#39;s going to be a big change for me. I don&#39;t quite know what to make of shedding a professional identity that I&#39;ve held for almost 10 years.</description>
