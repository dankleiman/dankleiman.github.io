      <description>The eyes are the gateway to your nervous system.
This is a theme that my teacher Bruce Frantzis weaves into many different Tai Chi and qigong teachings that he gives.
Relaxing the nervous system is one of the central goals of Tai Chi practice. With a relaxed nervous system you are more aware of your reactions, thoughts, emotions, and really, your entire internal environment.
One of the best ways to begin to tune into the state of your nervous system is by learning to feel your eyes.</description>
