      <description>I remember the first time I really got a sense for &#34;opening and closing&#34; my joints. We were on a qigong retreat and the person who was helping me probably spent 20 minutes &#34;pulsing&#34; my wrist, so that the fluids in the joint were moving in a smooth, even way, alternately creating more and less space between the bones.
When you pulse, you&#39;re manipulating the fluid flows inside your body so that the spaces inside your body compress and expand.</description>
