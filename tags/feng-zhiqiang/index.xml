      <description>Feng Zhiqiang was a famous Tai Chi Master from Beijing who was a major influence on my teacher Bruce Frantzis. Master Feng did some teaching in the West as well and we are fortunate to have access to a transcript of a 2001 workshop he taught in the Bay Area (thanks to the folks at SilkReeler.com for making this transcript available and thanks to Igor for sending it my way!).</description>

      <description>My friend Jess makes a point of studying with as many different teachers as he can. His goal isn&#39;t to dabble in a lot of different styles or systems. He is faithful and dedicated to his main practice, but he knows that each time he gets exposed to a new system, he learns something about his own.
See if you can glean one new thing from each of these qigong videos from YouTube to refine and improve your practice today.</description>
