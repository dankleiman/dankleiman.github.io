      <title>Health Month Wrap-Up</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As March comes to an end, I&#39;m wrapping up playing &lt;a href=&#34;http://healthmonth.com&#34;&gt;Health Month&lt;/a&gt;, an online game that helps you integrate new habits and change behavior. Here&#39;s my review of Health Month and a recap of what I experienced. I have to say, I don&#39;t think I really explored it to the fullest, but there were a couple of things I really liked about it and a couple of things I didn&#39;t connect with in the design.&lt;a id=&#34;more&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;more-789&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, what didn&#39;t really work for me, then what I really like about this tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Point System&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Each day when you &#34;play your turn&#34;, you get a number of points for the rules you follow (set up at the beginning of the month) and lose points for the ones you don&#39;t. My problem was, the points didn&#39;t really have meaning for me. What was much more valuable for me was recognizing the connection between following the rules and how I felt, both in terms of succeeding in the task of following them, and in terms of how healthier habits made me feel physically. More on this below...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Social Aspect&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Now, you are supposed to be able to regain points and be held accountable by interacting with other people. I never connected in to this layer of the game, so it was hard to put weight behind the points or more public accountability. Maybe if I had started playing with someone I already knew, I would have found this aspect more compelling. It&#39;s probably pretty necessary to make these connections right away and I think there are ways to find people with similar rules or goals. I just never pulled the trigger on this piece of it because I wanted to ease into playing, but a couple of weeks in, I think not having that social pressure made it easier for me to ignore the game more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Having a Month&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I really like that the time frame is set as a month, for two reasons. First, the reset is right around the corner. Every month is a fresh start if you really get off track. Second, setting a goal for a behavior over a span like 30 days is much more manageable than saying you want to do something &#34;from now on&#34;, or as they call it at the Stanford Persuasive Technology Lab, adopting a &#34;Path Behavior&#34;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s an explanation of the Fogg Behavior Model:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;object classid=&#34;clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000&#34; width=&#34;425&#34; height=&#34;349&#34; codebase=&#34;http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0&#34;&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowFullScreen&#34; value=&#34;true&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowscriptaccess&#34; value=&#34;always&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;src&#34; value=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/v/VqqJOMcd2zI?fs=1&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;rel=0&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowfullscreen&#34; value=&#34;true&#34; /&gt;&lt;embed type=&#34;application/x-shockwave-flash&#34; width=&#34;425&#34; height=&#34;349&#34; src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/v/VqqJOMcd2zI?fs=1&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;rel=0&#34; allowscriptaccess=&#34;always&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s interesting though, that Dr. Fogg recently tweeted this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/#!/bjfogg/status/35456115961638912&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Our data shows: People want to achieve Path Behaviors most. But they should really focus on Span Behaviors. www.behaviorgrid.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The difference between a &#34;span&#34; behavior and a &#34;path&#34; behavior is duration. &#34;From now on&#34; is too indefinite for most people to really master. When you limit the change you are aiming for to one month, though, you are creating a more manageable goal.&amp;Acirc;  Health Month makes you shoot for &#34;span&#34; behaviors by design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using Rules&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
There was something that really clicked for me about formulating my Health Month goals as rules. Rules guide you from vague goals into concrete actions. I had to think through weekly situations and envision when I was going to follow my rules. The rules had to be crafted in ways I could reasonably follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a golden mean between doing things differently and doing them in a sustainable way. Fast changes, where you try to re-shape everything in your life, don&#39;t work. Imagine waking up one morning and deciding that your are going to do everything different, eat, exercise, work, interact. You can&#39;t do it. Part of that has to do with how weak our willpower really is. When you have to exercise a lot of self-control, you literally drain energy from your cognitive abilities (Chip and Dan Heath go through great examples of this and the concept of visualizing habits you want to ingrain ahead of time in &lt;a href=&#34;http://heathbrothers.com/switch/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Switch&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the other extreme is not changing at all or changing the wrong things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that most of what you do should be driven by habit. That&#39;s the most efficient way to do things. But, you have to be thoughtful about the habits you want to create in life, and work hard at the systems and practices that are going to develop the habits you want. It&#39;s a strange mindset, I know. The cognitive work is in building the systems. Leave the rest to your nervous system&#39;s natural ability to adapt and make habits. I think Health Month helped me see this more clearly and I look forward to &#34;playing by the rules&#34; now even more!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My Rules Are Lame</title>
      <link>/dankleiman.github.io/2011/03/07/my-rules-are-lame/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 07 Mar 2011 08:54:21 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/dankleiman.github.io/2011/03/07/my-rules-are-lame/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, with one week of &lt;a href=&#34;http://healthmonth.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Health Month&lt;/a&gt; under my belt, I think one thing is clear: I picked some pretty lame rules for March! I mean, they&#39;re pretty plain and looking at some of the other options, I definitely could have picked something more interesting. I chose:&lt;a id=&#34;more&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;more-680&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bring lunch to work 3x per week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Track food at least 6x per week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise at least 5x per week&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I picked those rules initially because I thought they would be easy to track and measure and because I had already been working on them in February. I wanted to get a feel for Health Month and use it to cement these new habits. It was definitely a safe, baby-sized step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, I started tracking food and exercise, to try to see if I had any daily or weekly patterns. That was the origin of my own February &#34;rules&#34;, pre-Health Month. I knew I didn&#39;t eat as well as I wanted to for the week when I failed to plan for mid-week lunches, hence the 3x per week bring lunch rule. Similarly, I knew it was harder to track food for me during the weekend, so instead of fighting weekend habits as much, I decided to tighten up during the week, when I had more flexibility and time to prepare anyway. For the exercise rule, I had been experimenting with a recurring Google calendar event, with an SMS reminder, to try to get something in Monday-Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, coming in to getting set up in Health Month for March, I figured I would&amp;Acirc;  just map these rules on to the new system to get a feel for how the Health Month triggers reinforced the behavior I was in the process of trying to adopt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know? When I put it that way, I don&#39;t feel as lame.....Haha. In fact, what I realize now, is that I&#39;m going to be even more motivated to put some really interesting rules in play for April. That should be fun!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Signing the Contract</title>
      <link>/dankleiman.github.io/2011/03/04/signing-the-contract/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 04 Mar 2011 08:38:28 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/dankleiman.github.io/2011/03/04/signing-the-contract/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignleft size-full wp-image-674&#34; title=&#34;Commitment&#34; src=&#34;dankleiman.github.io/uploads/2011/03/Commitment.bmp&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;550&#34; height=&#34;413&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of playing Health Month is signing a contract to commit to follow your rules....and I was really surprised when I did it! &lt;a id=&#34;more&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;more-672&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;One of the things I&#39;m thinking about while playing is how this is different from simply tracking what you eat, when you work out, and even setting goals in other areas. I didn&#39;t think it was going to be a big deal to actually sign this commitment, but it was. I have to say, I got a little nervous before I clicked on my name there. How many electronic signatures or license agreements do you sign online all the time? But this felt just a little bit different and I think that&#39;s an ingenious feature!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>March is Going to be Health Month</title>
      <link>/dankleiman.github.io/2011/02/21/march-is-going-to-be-health-month/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 21 Feb 2011 09:40:16 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/dankleiman.github.io/2011/02/21/march-is-going-to-be-health-month/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m pretty excited to try this one out. Health Month is a behavior change game where you set rules to follow each month and do daily tracking, with rewards and penalties for how well you follow them. I&#39;m just digging into it, but so far it looks like you can choose &#34;do more of this&#34; or &#34;do less of that&#34;.&lt;a id=&#34;more&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a id=&#34;more-638&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I like the idea of limiting the scope of the goal to a month (what BJ Fogg calls a &#34;span&#34; behavior instead of a &#34;path&#34; behavior -- and says the key to long term change is focusing on span not path) and the immediate feedback from daily tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m curious about the reward system, to see if it really is compelling and there also is some kind of social wrinkle where you can help and get help from other players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the site, here&#39;s how to play:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;How to play&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;definition_summary&#34;&gt;Are you new to Health Month?  Here&#39;s the quick and dirty.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Health Month is all about making small improvements to your health,  one month at a time.  Players (that&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;s you!) can choose 1 or more rules  to try to stick to for a month from the many different dietary, fitness,  relationship, mental health, and financial health behaviors that are  currently in the game.  For first time players, 1-5 rules is a nice way  to start.  Choose rules that you want to work on, and try to make small  improvements to your current behavior rather than going cold-turkey,  whole-hog, or crazy-wombat.  You can always ratchet up the difficulty  next month,  once you get the hang of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are life points?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you commit to your rules, you start each month with 10 shiny  new life points.  The goal is to end the month with at least 1 life  point.  You lose a life point whenever you don&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;t stick to one of your  rules, but don&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;t worry if you lose all of your life points &amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&#34; that&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;s what  friends are for!  Friends and other players of Health Month have your  back when you need to be healed (this is a big part of why Health Month  totally rocks compared to other health plans and services).  This game  is NOT about making you feel guilty.  It&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;s  about helping you discover what works for your current lifestyle (do  more of that) and what doesn&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;t (skip it).  Also, if you accidentally  over-commit yourself and and lose all of your life points (I&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;ve seen  some people go to -100 life points and more!  Maybe there should be an  award for being ambitious?), it just means you can take it a little  easier next month.  Life is long.  Small improvements will make a bigger  impact long term.  And, by the way, you can still play the game if you  are -100 life points&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;brvbar; everything still works as usual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When do I play?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every day, during the month that you&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;ve committed to play, you can  come to the site and play your turn.  Spin the Wild Wheel if you feel  like adding an extra helping of whimsey to your game (don&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;t worry, most  of the outcomes are positive) or you can skip it and go straight to  filling out your daily scorecard without collecting $200.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do I do with fruit?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you follow all of your rules for a day, you get a piece of fruit.   You can use fruit to heal other players who have lost life points.   It&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;s a good thing to do, because they&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;ll remember you when you need to  be healed in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where are my friends?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow friends and team mates on Health Month to see a stream of how  everyone else is doing with their game (think Twitter or Facebook for  improving your life).  You&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;re all in it together, and posting questions,  tips, fears, and challenges that you run into helps remind you that  things like this work better when they&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;re done with friends and family.   Don&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;t be afraid to invite them!  :)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
