      <description>Here&#39;s a quick update on what we&#39;ve been working on during Immersion Week 2014.

I&#39;m very impressed (and I say so in the video about 15 times!) with the way this group has patiently explored many different facets of the Swings and Spine Stretch without rushing ahead to try to fit seemingly contradictory pieces together conceptually.
Instead, they&#39;re doing a great job experiencing/exploring each different component on its own.</description>

      <description>The Three Swings from Energy Gates are some of the most challenging exercises to do well in the entire Energy Arts curriculum. You have to relax, maintain good alignment, and coordinate stepping and turning while moving faster than most other qigong exercises.
Let&#39;s talk a little bit about why the Three Swings are important and what you need to integrate to do them well.
