      <title>Returning to an Old, Familiar Practice</title>
      <link>/dankleiman.github.io/2014/05/02/returning-to-an-old-familiar-practice/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s easy to get caught in a linear, progress-oriented way of thinking about your practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&#39;s new? What can I learn next? Am I improving...all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You get so caught up in doing it right and refining every little detail that you can lose sight of the what&#39;s really great about practice in the first place...the restoration, integration, and feeling of wholeness you can walk away with each time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Return to a Familiar Practice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
What if, instead of trying to always master something new, you went back to a practice you hadn&#39;t done in a while?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if that felt the same way it feels to see an old friend? Or visit a place you hadn&#39;t been in a long time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s an old friend I guess I&#39;d like you to meet (part of me was hoping this would be buried in YouTube&#39;s archives, never to surface again. Oh well!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of years ago, I wanted to see what it looked like from the outside to hold a posture for an extended period of time. In this video, I&#39;m holding the final posture of Tai Chi&#39;s Single Whip for 25 minute...but it&#39;s sped up so you can really see the changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/WALkgFQ9a2w&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; width=&#34;560&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s awful, right? You can see all the collapsing and poor breathing as I struggle through the duration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait. Why did I want to share this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oh, right, because every time I&#39;ve returned to this practice since that time, six months, a year, three years later, I can settle back into some of the practice grooves I established back then.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you return to an energetic practice like Standing Qigong, try not to just replicate the outward shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, look for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The feel of the posture (or movement) -- heavy, light, twisting, etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The energetic pattern that defines the practice -- sinking, rising, absorbing, projecting, etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The mind, the body, and the energetic pattern slotting into alignment, not immediately, but over a few minutes or several repetitions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This last piece, the alignment, is critical. Part of the challenge of remembering an old practice is that you remember what it felt like &lt;em&gt;at the end&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, you&#39;re settling in to it, so you have to keep the end in mind, but patiently wait for the pieces to slot together again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, this waiting, and the eventual alignment, returning to a familiar place, is what is truly restorative and energizing about this method of practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Return is the movement of the Tao.&lt;br /&gt;
Yielding is the way of the Tao.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All things are born of being.&lt;br /&gt;
Being is born of non-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: right;&#34;&gt;- Tao Te Ching, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/lao-tzu/works/tao-te-ching/te.htm&#34;&gt;Chapter 40&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Relaxing Your Feet to Find Your Root</title>
      <link>/dankleiman.github.io/2014/04/10/relaxing-your-feet-to-find-your-root/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 10 Apr 2014 08:44:05 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/dankleiman.github.io/2014/04/10/relaxing-your-feet-to-find-your-root/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When you settle into your practice each day, you should always give yourself a couple of minutes to just feel and see where your body, your energy, and your awareness are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one sense, each practice session is about bringing the rhythms of each of those into harmony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s why Tai Chi and qigong can be so powerfully restorative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you take a couple of minutes to just &#34;settle in,&#34; you&#39;ll discover several possible things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your overall energy level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What feels active and open.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What feels stuck or sluggish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specific body parts that are calling out, in good or bad ways.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Finding New Space in the Feet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The other day, I was settling in to practice and the soles of the feet really stood out (sorry!) from everything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the toes were hanging from the feet in a way that reminded me of this famous photo of workers having lunch on the beam of the Empire State building. Weird, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.afterimagegallery.com/nytconstructionworkers.htm&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; alt=&#34;nytconstructionworkers&#34; src=&#34;dankleiman.github.io/uploads/2014/04/nytconstructionworkers-300x274.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;274&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s what I think was going on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My ankles were relaxed, allowing the balls of the feet to connect to the ground.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The spaces between the toes opened up, allowing the individual toes to release.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I could feel each toe &#34;hanging&#34; and connecting the ground too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
And why was that like the workers on the beam?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more I stood and moved with this feeling, the more the ball of the foot -- the beam -- became a support structure I could sink into. The more I sunk into the ball of the foot, the more the toes -- all the workers up there on the beam -- relaxed and let go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, and this is the part that would freak me out if I were ever anywhere near the top of the Empire State building, &lt;strong&gt;the more I relaxed the more it felt like there was infinite space for my feet to relax down into&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn&#39;t that what&#39;s so amazing about the photo? The way that the workers are so relaxed and grounded, but they&#39;re dangling over hundreds of feet of empty space?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Creating Your Own Big Sensations from Tiny Spaces&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Now, I don&#39;t want you to go try to reproduce this sensation. Remember, I didn&#39;t set out to do it either. There is a way to practice that makes it more likely that you will have similar experiences, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The more time I&#39;ve spent getting familiar with interior space, through &lt;a title=&#34;Energy Gates Dissolving Series&#34; href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/energy-gates-dissolving-series/&#34;&gt;Standing Qigong&lt;/a&gt;, the more these spaces have opened up. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trick is to go in with the goal of feeling, not necessarily &#34;opening&#34; or &#34;releasing&#34; or &#34;sinking.&#34; Those are all techniques that evolve from feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First you feel, then as the structure, space, and relationships between areas of the body become more familiar, and your overall intention of sinking or rising meld with the well-mapped areas, experiences like this one just seem to pour out from deep inside the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you bumped into anything like this in your own practice? I&#39;m always curious to hear!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Yin and Yang of Problem Solving</title>
      <link>/dankleiman.github.io/2013/11/08/the-yin-and-yang-of-problem-solving/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 08 Nov 2013 09:46:58 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/dankleiman.github.io/2013/11/08/the-yin-and-yang-of-problem-solving/</guid>
      <description>&lt;img class=&#34;alignleft size-full wp-image-3831&#34; alt=&#34;following instructions&#34; src=&#34;dankleiman.github.io/uploads/2012/04/following-instructions.jpg&#34; width=&#34;240&#34; height=&#34;181&#34; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know how you can be banging your head against a wall, trying to figure something out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, you sleep on it, take a shower, or go for a walk and suddenly a solution pops into your head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wondered why this happens or how it works? So have I...and I don&#39;t know HOW it works, but I do know that we are practicing the exact same skill in qigong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s look at how it works in qigong, why you might be missing it, and how you can begin to recognize some of the same signs in other areas of your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;20 Repetitions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
People often ask why we do qigong sets in certain numbers. Whenever I&#39;ve heard Bruce Frantzis answer that question, he tells a story about these elaborate experiments they run in the Taoist monasteries, over generations, with control groups and varying repetitions, to see what the optimal number of repetitions for each exercise is. I always feel bad for the monks who spent their lives doing a few too many of each exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I think there&#39;s another reason to do somewhere around 20 reps of each exercises (in a typical qigong set). I tried to explain &lt;a title=&#34;Repetition as Rhythm: Why Do 20 Reps?&#34; href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/2011/04/28/repetition-as-rhythm-why-do-20-reps/&#34;&gt;how each group of reps feels to me in this post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this context, what I want you to start to look for is the moment when, after a certain number of repetitionss, you cross a threshold where internal rhythms can take over. Your directed, intentional mind can flip from &#34;doing&#34; to &#34;following.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In those moments when the solution to your problem finally dawns on you, don&#39;t you feel the same way? Your mind is open and the solution comes in. You&#39;re not bearing down on the problem with intention (and tension) the same way when you were trying to solve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tension and Relaxation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Now, if these really are parallel processes, some interesting connections emerge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems like you need a balance of doing and not doing, of tension and relaxation, or, as we&#39;ve been trained to think in qigong, yin and yang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For problem solving, most people focus on the yang moment of structure and intention, the active phase of &#34;working to solve the problem.&#34; Then, when we figure it out in the shower, &#34;out of nowhere,&#34; we beat ourselves up for not seeing it, or think we&#39;re stupid because now the solution is so obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But qigong teaches us that the yang phase is necessary to set up the yin phase. You have the prime the process actively before you can relax into the passive phase where a solution can emerge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How often have you approached a problem with the intention to solve it, then equally valued and created the space, time, and distance to let the yin phase of problem solving happen? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if we trained to let this happen the same way we train dissolving and sense our bodies, energies, and minds in qigong? &lt;em&gt;I know I could personally use more of this kind of practice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some more ideas on problem solving and letting solutions come to you:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Update on Quantity vs. Quality and the Struggle for Perfect Practice</title>
      <link>/dankleiman.github.io/2013/06/19/update-on-quantity-vs-quality-and-the-struggle-for-perfect-practice/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 19 Jun 2013 07:32:31 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/dankleiman.github.io/2013/06/19/update-on-quantity-vs-quality-and-the-struggle-for-perfect-practice/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few months ago we talked about &lt;a title=&#34;Are You Making Progress in Your Practice?&#34; href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/2013/03/26/are-you-making-progress-in-your-practice/&#34;&gt;the signs of progress in your qigong practice&lt;/a&gt;. For so many of us, the issue of &#34;progress&#34; is central to qigong or Tai Chi practice, since we are driven by the desire to get it right, to solve a problem like a health issue, or to reach an amorphous and elusive spiritual goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if we completely abandoned the idea of outcomes and perfection in practice? Instead, what if you started each day with a &#34;doing&#34; mindset in your qigong practice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take this example of a ceramics teacher from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Art-Fear-Observations-Rewards-Artmaking/dp/0961454733&#34;&gt;Art and Fear by David Bayles and Ted Orland&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;http://kk.org/cooltools/archives/000216&#34;&gt;In his review of the book&lt;/a&gt;, Kevin Kelly pulls this and many more excellent excerpts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The ceramics teacher announced on opening day that he was dividing the class into two groups. All those on the left side of the studio, he said, would be graded solely on the quantity of work they produced, all those on the right solely on its quality. His procedure was simple: on the final day of class he would bring in his bathroom scales and weigh the work of the &#34;quantity&#34; group: fifty pound of pots rated an &#34;A&#34;, forty pounds a &#34;B&#34;, and so on. Those being graded on &#34;quality&#34;, however, needed to produce only one pot -albeit a perfect one - to get an &#34;A&#34;. Well, came grading time and a curious fact emerged: the works of highest quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity. It seems that while the &#34;quantity&#34; group was busily churning out piles of work - and learning from their mistakes - the &#34;quality&#34; group had sat theorizing about perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
What does your Tai Chi practice look like if you focus on building quantity? One of my favorite examples is from Chinese Wrestling expert John Wang. In this short documentary, he demonstrates Tree Hanging for building martial power (and maybe other important attributes?):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;http://youtu.be/wqnQj1Lx02Y&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course Master Wang discusses technique and gives his student pointers, but when asked when the practice gets easier, he says, &#34;second year.&#34; That&#39;s a quantity mindset, to measure the progress of a daily practice by  year-over-year changes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, you don&#39;t need to go out and tear the flesh from your arm for a full year to build a foundation for your practice (and he doesn&#39;t think many people will do it anymore anyway), but is there an element of your practice that can be measured in quantity, not quality?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of whatever &#34;semester&#34; you are currently in, what component of your practice would you place on the bathroom scale? Where can you focus your time and effort to amass some serious practice skill?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, what high quality fruits will you be surprised with at the end of a quantity-driven period of practice?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Poll: What Does It Feel Like When You Meditate?</title>
      <link>/dankleiman.github.io/2013/05/24/poll-what-does-it-feel-like-when-you-meditate/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 24 May 2013 09:58:24 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/dankleiman.github.io/2013/05/24/poll-what-does-it-feel-like-when-you-meditate/</guid>
      <description>&lt;img class=&#34;alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-4629&#34; alt=&#34;help-browser&#34; src=&#34;dankleiman.github.io/uploads/2013/05/help-browser-150x150.png&#34; width=&#34;150&#34; height=&#34;150&#34; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was talking to a friend last night about &lt;a title=&#34;Guide to Standing Qigong&#34; href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/exercises/guide-to-standing-qigong/&#34;&gt;standing qigong&lt;/a&gt; and different &lt;a title=&#34;3 Layers of Neigong Practice and Taoist Meditation with Paul Cavel&#34; href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/2013/01/29/3-layers-of-neigong-practice-and-taoist-meditation-with-paul-cavel/&#34;&gt;meditation traditions&lt;/a&gt; that we had both tried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we say &#34;meditation&#34; in this context, we were including all practices like breathing for relaxation, Tai Chi, qigong, and sitting practices too. Part of what I&#39;d like to hear from you (see below) is how you define &#34;meditation&#34; in a way that&#39;s practical and part of your everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were many different reasons, on any given day, that we sought out the practice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To clear our heads of racing thoughts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To more deeply relax the body.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To explore layers of the mind and emotions that aren&#39;t so obvious during our normal busy days.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It seems like we had really similar reasons to practice, but I was left wondering if it &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; similar when we practice. What are the sensations that tell you you&#39;re on the right track? It seems like we want to end up in the same place, but are we taking the same road to get there?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Discovering Intrinsic Practice Motivation</title>
      <link>/dankleiman.github.io/2013/04/18/discovering-intrinsic-practice-motivation/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;Marden Hill Road Sunset II; Palermo, Maine by Jody Roberts, on Flickr&#34; href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/jroberts72/6003983172/&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignleft&#34; alt=&#34;Marden Hill Road Sunset II; Palermo, Maine&#34; src=&#34;http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6010/6003983172_fc0cfb3308_n.jpg&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; height=&#34;180&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;For the last couple of years, I&#39;ve been teaching regular workshops in Farmington, Maine. When I went up again last week, I had a fascinating conversation with one of the students. She was telling me how the core group had been coming along and that other people have come in and out of practicing with them. She said, &#34;you know, it&#39;s not really for everyone.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I don&#39;t know if that jumps out at you as a significant statement, but as a Tai Chi teacher, it&#39;s &lt;a title=&#34;Brookline Tai Chi has no &#34;Former Students&#34;&#34; href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/2010/12/01/brookline-tai-chi-has-no-former-students/&#34;&gt;something I&#39;ve been thinking about for years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this one casual statement, she was really saying that her motivation to practice now comes from inside of herself. Along with a small group of dedicated classmates, she gets everything she needs from the practice itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s a remarkable attitude. Every day, we get bombarded by messages that tell us to buy something to become something or fit in with other people. To be able to have a practice that lives inside of you, that&#39;s validated by performing it for yourself, and grows because you feed it with energy and time, is really incredible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this episode of Qigong Radio, we&#39;re going to talk about how you discover your intrinsic motivation to practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me know what you think!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;img src=&#34;dankleiman.github.io/uploads/2013/03/20130326-094857.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20130326-094857.jpg&#34; class=&#34;alignleft size-full&#34; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I get the question all the time, or at least it&#39;s always implied, &#34;When am I going to get it?&#34; Or, &#34;how do I know if I&#39;m getting good at this?&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let&#39;s unpack a little bit of what&#39;s behind this question and then I want to share some different ways that I think you can answer this question on your own, without even asking your teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Practice Goals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m on a training trip this weekend out in New Mexico with &lt;a href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/robert-tangora-tai-chi/&#34;&gt;Robert Tangora&lt;/a&gt;. Robert is teaching to six of us, twice a day, for two hours each session and the only agenda is giving personal feedback. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did I travel across the country for this? Isn&#39;t there enough to work on in my regular weekly practice? What do I hope to get out of it (besides revisiting all my favorite restaurants in Santa Fe)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The open-ended opportunity to get personal feedback was intriguing to me for two reasons: one was that I value Robert&#39;s input and have learned a ton whenever I&#39;ve studied with him. I figured there would be lots more to take in if the week was tailored to my practice needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second reason was the format. By having two shorter classes per day, we&#39;re going to have big chunks of practice time in the afternoon and evening. Being on the other side of the country, with fewer work responsibilities, I knew I could devote some solid practice time to integrating the small chunks of feedback I&#39;d be getting in each session. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this training format is to set up a rapid feedback loop where new input is balanced with integrative practice, twice a day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, it&#39;s hard to feel the loop. You go to class once, maybe twice a week, and you can get swept up in whatever the teacher leads you through. In our busy lives, it&#39;s hard to find time to do additional practice, especially when carving out time to commit to class may have been a challenge in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of you who read this site are in the reverse situation. You get occasional input from an instructor in person, or did years ago, but now you have to figure out how to upgrade your practice on your own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both cases, we&#39;re all often left wondering, &#34;how do I know if I&#39;m making progress?&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Process vs. Outcomes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people that I talk to come to Tai Chi and qigong for the way it makes them feel. Or I should say, keep coming back to it because of the way it feels. There&#39;s nothing competitive or achievement-oriented about having a daily renewal activity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to weight lifters, triathletes, or your friend who plays in a softball league, you might get left feeling like you&#39;ve got nothing to show for your practice. The benchmarks and fruits of your practice are harder to discern because the endeavor is largely process-driven. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I want to suggest that &#34;process vs. outcome&#34; is a distinction you don&#39;t need to make. Instead, do both: create outcomes to shoot for, then settle into the process and enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learn more when I set small, measurable goals in my practice and furthermore, I feel much more confident answering the question, &#34;am I getting better?&#34; when mini-goals are part of my training routine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Quantity or Quality&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what should you measure? &lt;a href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/2012/12/17/tai-chi-moving-for-better-balance-with-dr-fuzhong-li/&#34;&gt;Do you hook yourself up to a balance machine&lt;/a&gt;? Measure the number of squats you can do in an hour (hint: fewer is better!)? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applied to qigong and Tai Chi, quantifying starts to get ridiculous pretty quickly...and it&#39;s not the right way to go about it, if your only goal is to reach a certain number. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tracking Quality Over Time&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I wrote an article for &lt;a href=&#34;https://dankleiman.wufoo.com/forms/q7p5x7/&#34;&gt;Paul Cavel&#39;s Inner Quest Journal&lt;/a&gt; explaining a tracking process I went through for a hundred days of spinal bowing. I would practice this one technique for 5 minutes a day and then record my experience in a spreadsheet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My rule was that I wasn&#39;t going to spend a lot of time writing about what happened and I wasn&#39;t going to spend a lot of time reading what I had written. I could only look back every once in a while to look for patterns. I didn&#39;t want the reflection time to outweigh the actual practice time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just the act of recording revealed something surprising: the next day when I started out, I was more aware of what I had done the previous day (since I had verbalized it) and could return to certain themes, more than I would have otherwise. This one little act helped me build more momentum around one practice principle than I had experienced ever before in this timeframe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Setting an Outward Goal to Find an Inward State&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the hundred-day spinal practice yielded such interesting results, I was on the lookout for a new way to bring structure to my practice. At Brookline Tai Chi, Don Miller was just beginning a Yiquan standing class and I caught the standing bug again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first class we talked about &#34;gates&#34; or practice thresholds that Yiquan Masters said held new insights and rewards when you passed through them. For standing postures, this was a time marker, 20 minutes, one hour, two hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had been down that road before with standing qigong, and knocked on the one-hour gate, but never really traveled through it. This time, though, something inside me clicked, and I found deep motivation to start up again. I say this because just standing by the clock can be awful, and not productive at all. Normally, I think you should spend lots of time just standing naturally, and seeing how long it is when you feel like it&#39;s time to quit. That will teach you a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For whatever reason at this point in time, though, building up to longer standing periods just seemed like the thing I needed to do. I&#39;ve gone through periods like this in the past, naturally slowing down until a 5-minute form would take me 30 minutes, for example. I&#39;ve never been back to that and I don&#39;t know how it happened in the first place, but at the time, that&#39;s what my system needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the standing experiment, the rule I set for myself was to find my natural threshold, then add one minute each day. So far, about 20 days in, this has felt like a good pace. For the first couple of weeks, I finished feeling like I wanted to do more. That&#39;s a good sign that I&#39;m not hitting internal resistance yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all goes well, I should be able to report back about the two-hour gate in the next couple of months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I told Don what I was doing, he said, &#34;well that doesn&#39;t sound very Taoist.&#34; But here&#39;s the thing. Over the years I&#39;ve learned if you only rely on your internal compass, the way the Taoist sages seem to advise, you get fooled into quitting too soon, thinking it&#39;s the natural way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More and more I believe that you need to set up artificial structures, like my time experiment, to reveal your true limits and fluctuations. If I let my arms down the first time I get tired, I will never realize that adjusting the foot or opening the hip would send a surge of energy that would boost the arms, and I could go on for five more easy minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there a limit on the other side where  you unnaturally force it? Of course. But if you never run little experiments in your practice, you&#39;ll never know the difference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, before you go off and set up an experiment for yourself, let me be clear, it&#39;s not just pushing through the number that&#39;s important. In fact, it&#39;s not really about pushing yourself at all. Instead, the structure of your practice creates a sort of backdrop for learning. When you return to the same scene each day, you pick up contrast and insight that you would miss otherwise. You set your natural internal fluctuations against the same practice conditions, so that you reveal new facets of the internal changes, not so that you beat the external number. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll try to give examples of different markers I discover along this current path as I go, and now that I&#39;ve told you about it, I guess I better keep moving!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
