      <description>Last week I had the pleasure of recording a conversation with my friend and Tai Chi colleague Dorothy Fitzer.
Drawing on her background in movement, energy arts, and psychotherapy, Dorothy has put together a very interesting group of practitioners from several different modalities to address the question of how embodiment practices can lead to nourishing, healing, and even transformative experiences.

Of course, I was thrilled to make the case that this is at the core of so much of what we do in Tai Chi.</description>

      <description>&#34;At some point, don&#39;t we have to ask ourselves, &#34;Aren&#39;t I healthy enough?&#34; Don&#39;t I need to work on &#34;waking up&#34;, on manifesting kindness and patience, and being other oriented?&#34;
That&#39;s from a conversation we&#39;ve been having in the Inner Form discussion group and it got me thinking.
You might be learning to cultivate your chi to heal old injuries or for the inner experience of meditative exploration, but at some point, shouldn&#39;t your practice extend into the world around you, to the people in your life, and your work?</description>
