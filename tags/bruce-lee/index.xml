      <description>In the process of building and launching Trainerfly, I&#39;ve tried to keep the wisdom of Bruce Lee in mind:

Too many people are &#34;looking at the finger&#34; when they think of technology. What&#39;s the point of lightning fast communication and access to an abundance of information? It has to come back to people communicating. Otherwise, it just doesn&#39;t mean a thing.
I hope that the proliferation of fast, ubiquitous communication technology accelerates so much, that people finally get beyond the finger-fascination and can start looking at the moon -- in all its heavenly glory -- again.</description>
