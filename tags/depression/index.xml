      <description>Last week I had the pleasure of recording a conversation with my friend and Tai Chi colleague Dorothy Fitzer.
Drawing on her background in movement, energy arts, and psychotherapy, Dorothy has put together a very interesting group of practitioners from several different modalities to address the question of how embodiment practices can lead to nourishing, healing, and even transformative experiences.

Of course, I was thrilled to make the case that this is at the core of so much of what we do in Tai Chi.</description>
