      <description>&lt;img class=&#34;alignleft size-medium wp-image-4998&#34; alt=&#34;Mixing all the elements of a good qigong practice.&#34; src=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/uploads/2014/01/iStock_000019067988Small-200x300.jpg&#34; width=&#34;200&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#34;Is it better to structure your practice to stay with one energy gate, such as the crown, until you feel some dissolving happening there, or should you just keep moving through the gates week by week moving onto another gate?&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excellent questions like this one keep pouring in. Thank you for sharing your practice experiences with me. I know other folks who read the blog really appreciate it too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love hearing from you guys, especially when your questions are grounded in exploration, practice and thoughtful reflection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check this next one out too. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever articulated the process of sinking chi as clearly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#34;I&#39;m basically aiming to keep my attention on each section of my body as I go down until I feel it has gone sung and has the sense that&#39;s its as relaxed as I&#39;m capable of - as well as the sensation that it has filled with qi (like the sponge analogy). Then I try to feel the leading edge of that fullness until it seeps down to the next section. Does this sound like I&#39;m sinking or dissolving? Or am I somewhere in between perhaps?&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you see the common thread in both of these questions? &lt;strong&gt;Both of these questions are about &#34;practice recipes.&#34;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Practice Recipes for Skill Acquisition&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;ve been reading about learning models a little more lately and I wanted to share the Dreyfus Model of Skill Acquisition with you. If you have the time, these slides give a great overview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe style=&#34;border: 1px solid #CCC; border-width: 1px 1px 0; margin-bottom: 5px; max-width: 100%;&#34; src=&#34;http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/3462945&#34; height=&#34;356&#34; width=&#34;427&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; marginwidth=&#34;0&#34; marginheight=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;a title=&#34;Dreyfus Model Of Skills Acquisition&#34; href=&#34;https://www.slideshare.net/cynthiajoffrion/dreyfus-model-of-skills-acquisition&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Dreyfus Model Of Skills Acquisition&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; from &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slideshare.net/cynthiajoffrion&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;cynthia joffrion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big takeaway is that any time you are building a new skill, it helps to block everything else out and use a set of context-free rules to hone the skill....or in other words, follow a recipe!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Did you notice that experts fall back on rules, recipes, and analysis when things get too complex too?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practice recipes help you separate signal from noise, what&#39;s important from what&#39;s irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look at the five stages in this model, you&#39;ll notice that at a certain point rules are replaced by patterns, then by decisions and intuition. As skills become ingrained, we subconsciously integrate more information than could possibly be explained and reduced to binary rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Practice Recipes in Standing Qigong&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
To apply this model to our standing practice, we need to adopt a novice mindset every time we practice a new way of standing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start out by asking yourself, &#34;if I want to build this skill, what rules should I follow?&#34; Practicing this way will give you &lt;strong&gt;focus and freedom&lt;/strong&gt;: you won&#39;t worry about a million different things and you&#39;ll be able to give your energy over to one or two simple tasks.&lt;br /&gt;
So if we return to the initial question and think about recipes, what do you notice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is it better to structure your practice to stay with one energy gate, such as the crown, until you feel some dissolving happening there, or should you just keep moving through the gates week by week moving onto another gate?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom: 5px;&#34;&gt;This question is equivalent to saying, &#34;I like my bread a little crispier and browner, I think I&#39;m going to leave it in the over for a few more minutes.&#34; The recipe says 25 minutes, but you&#39;re making a choice to leave it in for 30. And that&#39;s fine!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom: 5px;&#34;&gt;The person who asked this question is right on the edge of following the recipe to the letter and exploring, improvising and practicing &#34;to taste.&#34; I&#39;ve worked with a lot of people who don&#39;t play this edge enough. Either they lock themselves rigidly into a form or always go by feel. I don&#39;t think either of those is a good choice.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom: 5px;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instead, you should run through the recipe many times, to really understand the steps and start to see the potential for variation&lt;/strong&gt;, like &#34;I could stay at this gate longer and feel more going on.&#34; Then, when you&#39;ve found a place to go deeper, break away from the recipe and really explore.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom: 5px;&#34;&gt;In this case, any of gate, if it&#39;s a really productive area for you, could be a 2-week, 3-week, or month-long project.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom: 5px;&#34;&gt;In the &lt;a title=&#34;Energy Gates Dissolving Series&#34; href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/energy-gates-dissolving-series/&#34;&gt;Standing Dissolving Series&lt;/a&gt;, I&#39;m giving you weekly recipes to follow and taking you through a whole process, which you could also look at as one 6-month-long recipe to follow.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom: 5px;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My recommendation in this case is to follow the recipe until you feel confident and comfortable without it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style=&#34;margin-bottom: 5px;&#34;&gt;Deeply Ingrained Recipes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Re-read the second question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m basically aiming to keep my attention on each section of my body as I go down until I feel it has gone sung and has the sense that&#39;s its as relaxed as I&#39;m capable of - as well as the sensation that it has filled with qi (like the sponge analogy). Then I try to feel the leading edge of that fullness until it seeps down to the next section. Does this sound like I&#39;m sinking or dissolving? Or am I somewhere in between perhaps?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In addition to being a great description of &lt;a title=&#34;Sinking Your Mind through Your Body&#34; href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/2011/10/03/sinking-your-mind-through-your-body/&#34;&gt;sinking chi&lt;/a&gt;, I want you to notice that it&#39;s also an interesting blend of a clearly structured recipe, but also something that&#39;s done completely by feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you get to this stage with a particular skill, where you&#39;re feeling your way through it in a consistent pattern instead of thinking it through like a list of instructions, you&#39;re ready to layer new skills on top of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In this case, instead of following the leading edge and the seeping sensation, you tune in more to the energy &#34;behind&#34; the area that&#39;s releasing, without leaving that area. Hanging out here, with a listening attitude, sensing what unfolds next, will lead you into dissolving.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Form Versus Feel in Standing Qigong</title>
      <link>http://dankleiman.com/2014/01/09/form-versus-feel-in-standing-qigong/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 09 Jan 2014 09:55:48 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://dankleiman.com/2014/01/09/form-versus-feel-in-standing-qigong/</guid>
      <description>&lt;img class=&#34;size-full wp-image-2355 alignleft&#34; alt=&#34;Standing Qigong&#34; src=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/uploads/2011/10/basic-standing-posture.jpg&#34; width=&#34;159&#34; height=&#34;337&#34; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you set out to develop your internal energy using standing postures, there are two main ways you can go about it: &lt;strong&gt;by feel or by form&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, there will be a lot of overlap in these two broad approaches, like aligning your body with gravity without collapsing internally and progressively releasing and relaxing as you stand, but when it comes to the role of the mind, form and feel can be very different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Feeling Approach&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You stand &#34;by feel&#34; for a few different reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, a good period of feeling, taking stock, and getting comfortable is useful almost any time you do your standing practice. Because our initial orientation in standing is inward, and we&#39;re likely coming to it from a lot of outward-facing activity, taking 3, 5, or even 10 minutes to just stand and feel creates a nice buffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;ve settled in to your practice, then any &#34;form&#34; work you do for the remainder of the standing session will be much more productive: you&#39;ll be quieter, more relaxed, and more tuned-in to your internal environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In fact, I recommend that you get to a comfortable baseline of just being able to settle, relax, and feel your body in a standing posture for 20 minutes before you move on to the form phase.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason to take the feeling approach is to fully appreciate the effects of your posture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The posture pictured above is a neutral posture, also referred to as Wu Chi. As soon as you raise the arms or change the stance, the effect of the body position will begin to shape what you feel, physically and energetically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, if you pick a different posture, you automatically start doing a different form. You don&#39;t need to do anything special with the mind. Just feeling the new effects of a specific posture, compared to your Wu Chi baseline, can be enough to keep you occupied through much longer (2-hour!) standing sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, by taking the feeling approach, you can build your connection to the ground. As you stand, &lt;a title=&#34;3 Essential Questions to Ask Yourself During Standing Qigong&#34; href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/2012/07/02/3-essential-questions-to-ask-yourself-during-standing-qigong/&#34;&gt;ask yourself these 3 questions&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Over time, you will become more rooted, relaxed, and connected&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Moving into Standing Forms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Once you have a solid baseline of feeling the body, you can begin to work on the form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, most people are familiar with Tai Chi Forms or choreographed sequences in other martial arts, but what do we mean when we use the word &#34;form&#34; in this context?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don&#39;t think of &#34;form&#34; as movements, but instead think of it as a procedure, then it starts to make more sense. And the value of having a procedure, or a repeatable process, is that you can begin to see how you&#39;re changing over time by performing it, both because you can use it as reference point and because doing it actually changes you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In standing, the form is going to be what you do with your awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here I want to warn you:&lt;/strong&gt; just like someone who follows the rote choreography of the Tai Chi form with no regard for softness, relaxation, and connection will be really stiff and awkward, if you follow the mind-forms without regard for the qualities you develop in the feeling approach, you will be stiff and awkward in your standing. You will just be going through a rigid mental checklist and the impact you will have on your energy and physical body will be limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if you can introduce a pattern of progressively sinking the mind through the body, while you maintain relaxation, connection, and root, all of the qualities you began to develop in the feeling approach will be amplified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Your First Form: Downward Flow&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In Opening the Energy Gates of Your Body, Bruce Frantzis teaches a standing qigong sequence that is designed to clear stagnant chi out of your energetic system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic process is a standing &#34;form&#34; where you begin at the crown of the head and move your mind downward through the body each time you practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the first level, an Energy Gates practice session is structured like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Settle In (using the feeling method described above)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Downward Scan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stillness, Settling Again, or Storing Chi&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The more you practice Energy Gates, the more you will refine the Downward Scan piece. &lt;strong&gt;Specifically, you will go through stages of feeling your body to feeling your energy to sinking your energy and finally to dissolving your energy. &lt;/strong&gt;Bruce discusses each of these stages in depth &lt;a title=&#34;Opening the Energy Gates by Bruce Frantzis is The Most Important Qigong Book To Have in Your Library&#34; href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/2011/10/31/opening-the-energy-gates-by-bruce-frantzis-is-the-most-important-qigong-book-to-have-in-your-library/&#34;&gt;in the Energy Gates book&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At each stage of this process, though, the form is the same. You start at the top and work your way down. Every time you go through the body this way, no matter at what layer, you are strengthening the downward current of energy, which has a powerful restorative effect over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often joke that the downward flow of chi in your body plays the same role as the downward flow of water in the plumbing system of your house. Not enough downward flow is a problem there, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Energy Gates Over Six Months&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When you read the book or hear someone explain the Energy Gates process, it&#39;s easy to picture a whole bunch of dots all over the body that light up as you do your scan. In fact, learning to feel the gates themselves is a natural extension of just being able to feel the denser tissues of the body directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to tune the mind to a slightly different frequency, but all the time spent standing and feeling pays off here: you&#39;ve trained your mind to stay in one spot for extended periods without jumping around and without tensing up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you set out to do a complete pass through all the gates, it roughly breaks down into a six-month project. There are 23 main places you&#39;ll want to work with and you could work with one per week (you can definitely spend longer on each gate, but this is just the basic formula). Here is the list from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.energyarts.com/energy-gates-qigong&#34;&gt;the Energy Arts resource page&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bai hui, or the crown of the head.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The third eye, the eyes, the center of the ears and the temple. Also the four jaw points.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where the tongue touches the roof of the mouth and the throat notch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The base of the skull and in between each of the cervical (neck) vertebrae down to the seventh cervical vertebra at the base of the neck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From where the tongue touches the roof of your mouth to the end of the breastbone, on a line about the width of your mouth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The four points of the shoulder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The elbows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The wrists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The hands (all the points).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The joints where the ribs connect to the sternum, the spaces between the ribs, the joints where the ribs connect to the spine, the area between the shoulder blades and the spine. For women only: the gates of the breasts (directly behind the nipples).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The solar plexus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The whole of the belly, starting from the front and dissolving through the internal organs back to the spine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The tantien and the mingmen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All the points along the spine, from the occiput to the tailbone, paying special attention to the occiput, the seventh cervical vertebra, the vertebra in the center of the shoulder blades, the one at the base of the shoulder blades, mingmen and the tailbone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The hip sockets, the pelvic bones, and the kwa (that is, the area inside the front crest of the hip bones).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The anus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The genitals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The perineum.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The knees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ankles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The feet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Below the floor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Above the head.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Now, when you start working through the gates, the structure of your practice session will change from what we laid out earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in week 1, it could look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Settle In  - 5 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feel the Crown of the Head - 5 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan Down through the Body - 3 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Storing Chi - 2 minutes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
But week 11 would look something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Settle In  - 5 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feel from the Crown of the Head down to the Solar Plexus - 5 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feel the Solar Plexus - 8 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan Down through the Rest of the Body - 5 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Storing Chi - 2 minutes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In other words, you should spend a substantial amount of time on whatever gate is the &#34;gate of the week.&#34; However, your practice session should always start with settling, finish with gathering, and have an easy flow down to the &#34;gate of the week&#34; and then from the &#34;gate of the week&#34; down into the ground after the main focus time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ll notice that as you go through the process of the gates, your standing time can go from 15-20 minutes during the first few weeks up to 45-60 minutes towards the end of the process. If you can only manage 15-20 minutes and slowly adding more feels like too much of a strain, I recommend that you stick with the feeling method and not worry about the gates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is it Very Taoist?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Here you might start to wonder about whether some of these guidelines for the form seem too rigid. How do you reconcile these recommendations with what you feel when you stand free-form?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And by the way, I&#39;m not saying that &#34;feeling&#34; is kindergarten and &#34;form&#34; is more advanced. In fact, you should cycle between periods of each as you practice over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guidelines and form serve a purpose. You need to work through the structure to develop certain things. Eventually, will you have a more intuitive feel for what you need and how much? Of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the mean time, though, Flannery O&#39;Connor captured the issue well, when she argued for a classical education: &#34;And if the student finds that this is not to his taste? Well, that is regrettable. Most regrettable. His taste should not be consulted; it is being formed.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However counter-intuitive it seems at first, the best feeling, the most relaxation, and the greatest internal stillness that I&#39;ve ever uncovered has come from the practice periods when I&#39;ve given over to a form to follow. Later on, I can bask in that energy and &#34;just feel&#34; and enjoy it, but to get there, it was a lot of little small, formal steps along the practice road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wherever you find yourself on the standing path now, I hope this helps orient you a little more. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Outer Dissolving and The Role of the Mind in Standing Qigong</title>
      <link>http://dankleiman.com/2013/12/30/outer-dissolving-and-the-role-of-the-mind-in-standing-qigong/</link>

      <guid>http://dankleiman.com/2013/12/30/outer-dissolving-and-the-role-of-the-mind-in-standing-qigong/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Next month, we&#39;ll be starting a new Energy Gates course at &lt;a title=&#34;Brookline Tai Chi&#34; href=&#34;http://brooklinetaichi.org&#34;&gt;Brookline Tai Chi&lt;/a&gt;, focused on Outer Dissolving and working through the Gates of the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you work on dissolving the gates, you will inevitably be fighting the urge to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;visualize instead of feel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&#34;chase&#34; energetic releases, untethered from the physical body&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wonder if you are really feeling anything at all&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In this episode of Qigong Radio, I&#39;ll give my recommendations for avoiding these pitfalls and for &lt;strong&gt;setting up the conditions for actual energetic resolution&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;ll indulge me, I&#39;ll even share one of my favorite passages from Moby Dick and tell you why I think it&#39;s a perfect description of standing qigong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[powerpress]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can also subscribe to Qigong Radio via:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On November 9, I&#39;ll be teaching a seminar for my friend Chris Cinnamon at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.chicagotaichi.org/&#34;&gt;Enso Tai Chi&lt;/a&gt; (registration details &lt;a title=&#34;Seminars&#34; href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/seminars/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year we&#39;ll continue the &#34;Put More Chi in Your Tai Chi&#34; theme that we started last year by focusing on Tai Chi Rooting, Sinking Chi, Dissolving, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is to give everyone a clear sense of how nourishing it can be to find your root and feed it through solo exercises and interactive partner practice. Basically, you learn to continuously release and dissolve tension, stress, and pain, but more than just shedding uncomfortable feelings, you actually tap into a restorative wellspring of energy that keeps bubbling up the more you go down into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re in the area, come join us for a great day of training!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For background on the seminar, it helps to understand the different facets of Tai Chi Rooting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Two Kinds of Tai Chi Rooting&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
My Push Hands teacher &lt;a title=&#34;The Essential Elements of Tai Chi Balance Training&#34; href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/2013/07/18/the-essential-elements-of-tai-chi-balance-training/&#34;&gt;Don Miller&lt;/a&gt; explains that there are two kind of &#34;root&#34; in Tai Chi: &lt;strong&gt;intrinsic root&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;situational root&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intrinsic root is the degree of root you are either born with, or have developed through practice over time, that spills into everything you do. Think of the most grounded person you know. They exude a high degree of intrinsic root, either physically or emotionally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the fruits of Tai Chi practice have to do with increasing your intrinsic root and this is often why we see people mellow or soften as their practice matures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cultivating Intrinsic Root&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The most common way to build intrinsic root in Tai Chi is through standing practices, either holding qigong postures or postures drawn directly from the Tai Chi form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, you&#39;re not just &#34;standing around.&#34; You have to go through &lt;a title=&#34;Guide to Standing Qigong&#34; href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/exercises/guide-to-standing-qigong/&#34;&gt;several stages&lt;/a&gt; to get to rooting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, you have to land the mind inside the body, or at least on, and begin to become present to sensations other than pain and discomfort.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then, you have to let the mind soak deeper and deeper into the body, transforming the tissues, making them wetter, heavier, and denser. This will happen naturally, like water soaking into a sponge, as circulation of fluids and chi increases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, as you refine your posture and alignments, the heavy feeling will move &lt;em&gt;through you&lt;/em&gt;, instead of just weighing you down (which is a sign of internal collapse). You start to feel lighter and more open, but someone lifting up your arms or legs would still perceive the heaviness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In some standing qigong methods, like &lt;a title=&#34;Opening the Energy Gates by Bruce Frantzis is The Most Important Qigong Book To Have in Your Library&#34; href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/2011/10/31/opening-the-energy-gates-by-bruce-frantzis-is-the-most-important-qigong-book-to-have-in-your-library/&#34;&gt;Opening the Energy Gates&lt;/a&gt;, there is also a method for refining your sense of blocked internal energy, so that you begin to &#34;dissolve&#34; blocked chi. While dissolving is a healthy practice to undertake for its own sake, in this context, &lt;strong&gt;it gives you an extra advantage: as you become more aware of your internal energy, you start to feel the &#34;chi of ____.&#34; &lt;/strong&gt;In other words, you feel the chi of your leg or your kidneys or your feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of rooting, you begin to notice that your mind, and therefore your chi, has jumped up into your head, and is no longer feeding your root through your legs....and you notice this right before you go flying away!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rooting as a Response&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In the following video, I show how situational root, or rooting as a response to another person, has to do with finding just the right amount of sinking and grounding, not fighting or running away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/embed/dbt1nC9jypI&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; width=&#34;560&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here again, Lee I-Yu&#39;s advice from &lt;a href=&#34;http://scheele.org/lee/classics.html#Essentials&#34;&gt;The Essentials of the Practice of the Form and Push Hands&lt;/a&gt; is very helpful:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Desiring to attract to emptiness and deflect a thousand pounds, first you must know yourself and others. If you want to know yourself and others, you must give up yourself and follow others. If you give up yourself and follow others, first you must have the correct timing and position. To obtain the correct timing and position, you must first make your body one unit. Desiring to make the body one unit, you must first eliminate hollows and protuberances. To make the whole body without breaks or holes, you must first have the &lt;i&gt;shen&lt;/i&gt; [spirit of vitality] and &lt;i&gt;ch&#39;i&lt;/i&gt; [vital life energy] excited and expanded. If you want the &lt;i&gt;shen&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ch&#39;i&lt;/i&gt; activated and expanded, you must first raise the spirit (pay attention) and the &lt;i&gt;shen&lt;/i&gt; should not be unfocussed. To have your &lt;i&gt;shen&lt;/i&gt; not unfocussed, you must first have the &lt;i&gt;shen&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ch&#39;i &lt;/i&gt;gather and penetrate the bones. Desiring the &lt;i&gt;shen&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ch&#39;i&lt;/i&gt; to penetrate the bones, first you must strengthen the two thighs and loosen the two shoulders and let the &lt;i&gt;ch&#39;i&lt;/i&gt; sink down.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In other words, what makes situational root work is listening to the other person and responding to them at the right time, with the right sensitivity, with unified energy and an open body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What that will look like in your practice, over time, is something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn to feel your body&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sink your chi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open your energy field and correct alignments so that the physical body helps the energy become as full as possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add more complex movements that challenge your ability to stay present to your own internal state&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn interactive practices that teach you to tune into someone else&#39;s movement and energy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and finally, practice being grounded in the face of challenging interactions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Of course, like all Taoist learning processes, this one is circular. So while there are stages of skills to master here, you will also find that every time you go back to something earlier on the list, you will get more and more depth and richness out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the November 9 workshop, we will try to touch on as much of this as possible, including techniques for unifying the body and energy, sinking and dissolving chi, feeding the root through interactive practices, and also exploring how to use the solo Tai Chi form as a vessel for integrating as much of this as possible. &lt;a title=&#34;Seminars&#34; href=&#34;http://dankleiman.com/seminars/&#34;&gt;Learn more here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
