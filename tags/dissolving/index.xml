      <description>&#34;Is it better to structure your practice to stay with one energy gate, such as the crown, until you feel some dissolving happening there, or should you just keep moving through the gates week by week moving onto another gate?&#34;
Excellent questions like this one keep pouring in. Thank you for sharing your practice experiences with me. I know other folks who read the blog really appreciate it too.
I love hearing from you guys, especially when your questions are grounded in exploration, practice and thoughtful reflection.</description>

      <title>Form Versus Feel in Standing Qigong</title>

      <description>When you set out to develop your internal energy using standing postures, there are two main ways you can go about it: by feel or by form.
Now, there will be a lot of overlap in these two broad approaches, like aligning your body with gravity without collapsing internally and progressively releasing and relaxing as you stand, but when it comes to the role of the mind, form and feel can be very different.</description>

      <description>Next month, we&#39;ll be starting a new Energy Gates course at Brookline Tai Chi, focused on Outer Dissolving and working through the Gates of the body.
When you work on dissolving the gates, you will inevitably be fighting the urge to:
 visualize instead of feel &#34;chase&#34; energetic releases, untethered from the physical body wonder if you are really feeling anything at all

In this episode of Qigong Radio, I&#39;ll give my recommendations for avoiding these pitfalls and for setting up the conditions for actual energetic resolution.</description>

      <description>Inspiration for Rooting and Lengthening in Chicago
On November 9, I&#39;ll be teaching a seminar for my friend Chris Cinnamon at Enso Tai Chi (registration details here).
This year we&#39;ll continue the &#34;Put More Chi in Your Tai Chi&#34; theme that we started last year by focusing on Tai Chi Rooting, Sinking Chi, Dissolving, and more.
The goal is to give everyone a clear sense of how nourishing it can be to find your root and feed it through solo exercises and interactive partner practice.</description>
