      <description>Tai Chi has the potential to solve many common posture-related problems, but only if you follow the correct Tai Chi principles.
Specifically, you want to pay attention to the body alignments that unify the arms, legs, and spine, creating effortless openness throughout the skeletal system.
In Tai Chi, the way you hold your neck and head and release the pelvis into the legs are the exact opposite of what those of us who sit all day do.</description>
