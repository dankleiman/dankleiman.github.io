            <div id="content">
                <p>Qigong meditation is a system that promotes proper breathing, motion, healing and relaxation. Inspired by Chinese philosophy and medicine, the practice involves balancing and restoring chi (qi -- as in qigong), which is known as life energy. Being in a calm and mindful state is necessary to guide the chi through the body. Qigong is used to open up greater awareness and enliven the inner spirit. Sitting qigong meditation is done in China and many other countries around the world.</p>
<p>The energy flow, or chi, connects physical beings and spirits. It is a fundamental element in Chinese arts and medicine. Qigong consists of mental and physical training that sometimes requires the use of external aids, like herbs.</p>
<p><a title="What Are The Benefits Of Doing Qigong Prior To Meditation?" href="http://dankleiman.com/2012/05/07/what-are-the-benefits-of-doing-qigong-prior-to-meditation/">Sitting qigong meditation</a> is carried out in an upright seating position. This position has several benefits.  You strengthen your back without the need for a support. Sit on the front part of the bed or chair with the feet planted firmly and evenly on the ground. The hands should be rested on the thighs. You should feel as if a string is being pulled upward from your head, straightening your spine.</p>
<p>Sitting upright for meditative purposes has strong effects. The muscles in the spine and torso become strengthened. The posture is improved, and the mental concentration is enhanced. Good posture heals tense or damaged muscles. Having a solid backbone will improve willpower and self-awareness.</p>
<p>Healthy alignments are one way to reduce constant stress. You learn how to relax every part of  your body. You improve your inner energy. The blood circulates more freely, <a title="My Favorite Breathing Hack" href="http://dankleiman.com/2012/01/30/my-favorite-breathing-hack/">the breathing comes more easily</a> and the energy flows more freely throughout the body. Awareness is a major benefit of upright sitting. Practitioners must be meditative along with alert and fully aware. Transitioning into a meditative state is not always easy. Also, the state of lying down could induce sleep or reduce focus.</p>
<p>Over the last 25 years, qigong practice has spread beyond China. Millions of people believe in the benefits of sitting meditation. People who are interested in this practice are also interested in exercise, self-healing and alternative medicine. The upright posture is one of the most comfortable ways to mediate. It is important to remember that no practice should be straining or uncomfortable. Ideal efforts are never gained through overstrain. The benefits are worth the time and efforts used to achieve the best healing process.</p>
