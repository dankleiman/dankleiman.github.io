<p>The spine is the frame upon which our entire body hangs and the importance of proper spine maintenance cannot be overstated. In many western exercise routines the importance of proper spine maintenance is often overlooked and as a result practitioners often miss out on many of the benefits of the exercise. Tai Chi however keeps the spine in primary focus and there are many exercises specifically designed to address problems in this area. One of the most basic is the <a href="http://dankleiman.com/2013/03/11/basic-training-focus-on-your-kwa-squat/">Kwa squat</a>, which focuses its attention on the hip joint/inguinal area.</p>
<p>If you think you know how to do a proper squat, place a chair in front of your knees when you are sinking into the squat. In most cases your knees will push the chair forward as you lower your body. If you do this you are pressing in with your knees and losing most of the benefit of the squat. The three levels of using the Kwa are simple:</p>
<h2>Folding the Kwa</h2><br />

<ul>
<li>Begin in standing position.</li>
<li>Turn your hips to the right, maximizing the crease (remembering the 70% rule) and folding the Kwa.</li>
<li>Keep the "full" leg (weighted foot) stable and balanced.</li>
<li>Stop when the Kwa stops folding.</li><br />
</ul></p>
<h2>Bending and Stretching from the Kwa</h2></p>
<p><object id="viddler_Trainerfly_297" width="437" height="288" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" /><param name="allowNetworking" value="all" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="flashVars" value="f=1&amp;openURL=83541382&amp;autoplay=f&amp;loop=0&amp;nologo=0&amp;hd=0" /><param name="src" value="//www.viddler.com/player/d5ec6868/" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allownetworking" value="all" /><param name="flashvars" value="f=1&amp;openURL=83541382&amp;autoplay=f&amp;loop=0&amp;nologo=0&amp;hd=0" /><embed id="viddler_Trainerfly_297" width="437" height="288" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="//www.viddler.com/player/d5ec6868/" allowScriptAccess="always" allowNetworking="all" allowFullScreen="true" flashVars="f=1&amp;openURL=83541382&amp;autoplay=f&amp;loop=0&amp;nologo=0&amp;hd=0" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" allownetworking="all" flashvars="f=1&amp;openURL=83541382&amp;autoplay=f&amp;loop=0&amp;nologo=0&amp;hd=0" /></object></p>
<ul>
<li>When the Kwa stops folding you are ready to bend and stretch. Slowly elongate the muscles from your knees to you lower ribs.</li>
<li>Bend forward from your inguinal fold and then return to standing position.<b></b></li>
<li>Stretch you're inguinal by moving your body in a circle at the hips.<b></b></li>
<li>Repeat 3-4 times, both clockwise and counter-clockwise.<b></b></li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>These exercises lay the ground work for the Kwa squat. When you begin to sink into the squat remember the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>While you will want to stick the butt out, avoid the temptation.</li>
<li>Keeps the spine straight, letting the butt hang, like the anchor on a boat.</li>
<li>Keep the lower legs perpendicular to the ground.</li><br />
</ul><br />
The Kwa squat opens the sacroiliac joint, which is the connecting point between the spine and the legs and opening this connection fully makes movements much easier and increases both strength and <a href="http://dankleiman.com/inner-form/tutorial-on-hollowing-the-kwa/">flexibility of the spine</a>, hips and legs. The Kwa squat is designed to stimulate the joints in this region so that when you begin doing sets your body is full of energy filled movement.</p>
