<p>Here's <a href="http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/mba-earn-more-money/" target="_blank">a long post</a> from one of my favorite authors, Ramit Sethi. He often writes about putting ideas into action and I think this post is another great example, BUT, that's not what I want to highlight here.<a id="more"></a><a id="more-598"></a></p>
<p>First of all, I think this is my new favorite concept:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Skepticism is not a strategy.</strong></p>
<p>I spoke to one of my top Earn1k students last week &acirc;&euro;" she earned over $80,000 in 8 weeks &acirc;&euro;" and she was talking about how much her entire viewpoint has changed. Once you realize that you can control your situation &acirc;&euro;" how much you earn, how much you work, where you live, etc &acirc;&euro;" it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s amazing to look back at ourselves a few years ago&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;when we were skeptical and disbelieving that any of this could work.</p>
<p>Skeptics always have an excuse because it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s easier to be skeptical than to take the risk of trying something and possibly failing. Skeptics use codewords &acirc;&euro;" much like racists do &acirc;&euro;" to mask their fear and loathing of something different. For example, they&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll say they don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t have enough time (when everyone has the same 24 hours per day). They&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll complain about having &acirc;&euro;&oelig;already tried that,&acirc;&euro; but when you dig in and ask them what they actually tried, they&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll demur.</p>
<p>There&acirc;&euro;&trade;s nothing I hate more than vocal skeptics &acirc;&euro;" not only because they cheat themselves out of their own potential, but because they convince others that they can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t do it, either.</blockquote><br />
You can see this all over the place. It's another version of the Taoist saying that "you become what you practice". You can literally watch skeptics develop a hard shell of denial as they try fewer and fewer new things. I'm not necessarily blaming someone for this tendency, but I think it becomes a cycle that reinforces itself. That's why I love Ramit's writing: "skepticism is not a strategy" doesn't get into the blame, shame, or origin of the behavior, but it calls it out directly.</p>
<p>The way he writes just draws such clean lines. Take this distinction:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>I write for the As, Bs, and Cs &acirc;&euro;" but I systematically ignore one of them.</strong></p>
<p>Imagine  the world has As, Bs, and Cs in  any field. In this one, the As are  already managing their money,  they&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve read my book (and others), and  they&acirc;&euro;&trade;re earning as much as they  need to lead the lifestyle they choose. They&acirc;&euro;&trade;re already doing it.</p>
<p>The  Bs are the greatest in number. They  have the potential to do something  great, but for whatever reason &acirc;&euro;"  like actual barriers, self-imposed  barriers, or external  responsibilities &acirc;&euro;" they &Acirc; haven&acirc;&euro;&trade;t achieved what  their potential first. <em>They can be reached if you communicate to them in the right way.</em></p>
<p>The  Cs are a lost cause. Sure, they  might be salvageable to help, but  that&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not something I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m interested  in or capable of. This enrages  certain people who believe that we  should help everyone, but I live in  the world of practicality, not  utopia. If I have the chance to help an A  become an A+ in 3 months, or a  C become a B- in 3 years, who am I going  to choose? There are other  people who make it their life&acirc;&euro;&trade;s work to work  with Cs, but it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s not me.</p>
<p>And  so this is also applicable for you.  When I teach negotiation, or  interviewing, or automation, or even  earning more money, I teach you how  to focus on the right level of  analysis for you. It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s ok not to please everyone. I&acirc;&euro;&trade;d rather spend my  time hyper-focused on exactly your needs than try to serve everyone.</blockquote><br />
