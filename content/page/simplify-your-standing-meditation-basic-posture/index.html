<p>It would be rare in today's world to find someone that has not seen the smooth gentle <a href="http://dankleiman.com/videos/">movements of Tai Chi</a>, either on television or walking in the park on a sunny afternoon. While many observers see what appears to be Jackie Chan in slow motion, the movements being made are actually a form of meditation, much like Hatha Yoga, but with a different focus. "Stillness in motion" is the best way to describe someone moving through Tai Chi sets.</p>
<p><a href="http://dankleiman.com/2013/02/10/the-how-what-and-why-of-tai-chi-practice/">Beginning students</a> sometimes have a difficult time adapting to the meditative part of Tai Chi. Stepping out of a fast paced life and into the our minds can at first seem boring but, if done correctly the boredom never lasts long. New students will begin with learning standing meditation, in the Wu Ji posture. Learning the Wu Ji posture will <b>simplify your standing mediation basic posture</b> and make the transition from chaos to relaxation and harmony much easier.</p>
<ul>
<li>Locate you center by standing with feet shoulder width apart, arms and shoulders relaxed, faced forward.</li>
<li>Unlock and relax the knees, giving them a slightly relaxed bend.</li>
<li>Keep the spine erect, torso centered at the point between the bent knee and ankle.</li>
<li>Slowly inhale from the midsection, not from the lungs.</li>
<li>Materialize your breath. Visualize it as it moves in through your nostrils as a golden stream, carrying new energy to your body.</li>
<li>When you release the breath, visualize the toxins leaving your body as a puff of grayness leaving your mouth.</li><br />
</ul><br />
Once you feel you mind quiet you will be able to direct your intention away from your breathing, which should remain slow and steady automatically, to move around your body looking for tensions, anything that makes you feel uncomfortable, and direct the breath to those areas as you exhale. Visualize the tension melting through the body.</p>
<p>While Tai Chi can be learned and practiced solo, without the guidance of an instructor in the beginning, progress will be excruciatingly slow. An instructor working one-on-one with a student when <a href="http://dankleiman.com/exercises/guide-to-standing-qigong/">learning correct standing</a>, breathing and foot positions, is essential to a complete understanding of the art of Tai Chi Chuan. Once your muscle memory has the basics in place you will be able to study alone and many students do. Now that you are <b>learning to simplify your standing mediation basic posture</b> the next stages will be very simple.</p>
