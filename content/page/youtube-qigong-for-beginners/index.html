<p>Eating a balanced diet with plenty of vegetables and fruits while exercising on a regular basis is essential for health, but many people find that they can do more to stay healthy by practicing the ancient art of Qigong.</p>
<p>Developed in China, Qigong is designed to help you maintain health as well as heal the body and increase your vitality. For this reason, many people search YouTube for Qigong for beginners to see videos that will help them learn about this Chinese practice, which people have been using for thousands of years. It is useful for beginners to read <a title="Opening the Energy Gates by Bruce Frantzis is The Most Important Qigong Book To Have in Your Library" href="http://dankleiman.com/2011/10/31/opening-the-energy-gates-by-bruce-frantzis-is-the-most-important-qigong-book-to-have-in-your-library/">books about Qigong</a>, but they often will want to see Qigong videos to help them learn about the techniques more effectively.</p>
<h2>Maintain Health with Qigong</h2><br />
People who are just beginning to learn about Qigong find that it emphasizes dynamic training in which you move in fluid, choreographed motions such as the movements made by practitioners of Tai Chi.</p>
<p>Qigong also involves static training, in which practitioners hold various postures for long periods in a fashion reminiscent of yoga. Another aspect of Qigong is meditation training, with practitioners studying philosophy, focusing awareness on breathing, repeating mantras and visualizing positive outcomes. A fourth aspect of Qigong involves activities such as massage and herbs.</p>
<h2>Learn Qigong from the Comfort of Your Own Home</h2><br />
If you do not have access to a local Qigong teacher near your home or work, you can still learn how to improve your health with it by watching videos. A computer connected to the Internet enables you to search YouTube for Qigong for beginners. Someone will make videos of a Qigong teacher and then post them to YouTube.</p>
<p>Browsing or searching for Qigong videos on YouTube reveals a variety of information. Not only do you get to see the video itself, you can read information provided by the person who uploaded it. If the uploader enabled comments for the Qigong video, you can get a sense of what other people thought of it by reading their remarks.</p>
<p>If you like the Qigong videos that a particular person uploads to YouTube, you can sign in to your YouTube account and then mark each video to put it in your own Qigong playlist.</p>
<p>YouTube is accessible from a desktop or laptop computer, which you can watch on a large monitor to help you see all the details of each motion while listening to the instructor describe what is happening in terms that beginners will find easy to understand. If you become distracted, such as when the phone rings or someone comes to your door, you can always rewind the Qigong video to resume your learning session.</p>
